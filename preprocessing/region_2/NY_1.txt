As we celebrate 245 years later with flags and fireworks on July 4, it’s easy to forget these patriots risked death to give a new nation life. If you’ve never read the Declaration of Independence in its entirety, this is a good time to do that. More than two centuries later, it’s still a good read. These rebels, who would be accused of treason by Great Britain, wrote the document in a reasoned manner, attempting to convey to the world that their cause was a just one. At its most basic, it’s a demand for a divorce, with one party explaining why this marriage can’t be saved. What’s fascinating, though, is how the list of complaints about the king of England not only cited justification for the break-up, but also telegraphed the principles the new nation would insist upon in establishing its own governance. The entire document was a bold statement, speaking truth to power. As it established its own future, this new nation would have to find a way to guarantee free speech, particularly in regard to criticizing government. The Declaration of Independence lists more than two dozen examples of why the king “was unfit to be the ruler of a free people.” The new United States of America would need to create a check on those who abused their power. That would come from a free press. Much of the Declaration is devoted to examples of the king ignoring the colonies’ needs and maintaining a stranglehold on new legislation to address those needs. Clearly, the United States would have to guarantee petition and assembly. Memorably, the Declaration states that all men are endowed by their “Creator” with certain “unalienable rights.” This was an acknowledgement of a higher power without a specific reference to any religion. This new nation would go on to guarantee freedom of faith. Freedom of speech, press, and religion. The rights of petition and assembly. Today, we see all five nestled together in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It took a war for independence and 17 years, but those aspirations became the cornerstone for a young and vibrant country. Fast forward to the 21st century. A new survey of citizens around the globe by legal public-policy center Justitia has assessed how citizens in 33 countries feel about freedom of speech. It found that most citizens in most countries feel free speech is important and positive, but they waver when presented with scenarios in which free speech offends others or hampers society. In order, Norway, Denmark, the U.S., and Sweden top the list: Citizens of these nations say they are steadfast in their support of free speech. At the bottom of the list: Tunisia, Kenya, Egypt, and Pakistan. In a telling passage, Justitia quotes free-speech expert and Columbia University President Lee Bollinger as saying the U.S. is “the most speech-protective of any nation on earth, now or throughout history.” The report also notes that a 2015 Pew research study determined no nation in the world was more supportive of free speech and a free press than the U.S. At our best — and not without lapses — we walk that talk. In 1776, our founders published a Declaration of Independence, but also a declaration of intent. Those early Americans sought “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” by creating a nation founded on freedom. But those freedoms must never be taken for granted, and our collective vigilance is essential. On the most American of holidays, let’s be sure to celebrate the most American of freedoms. # # # Ken Paulson is director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University and former dean of the College of Media and Entertainment at MTSU.

The Clifton Park–based company now is operating in locations from Central New York to the Catskills and into the Berkshires in Massachusetts through these media partnerships. The latest media companies to come aboard include Oswego County News Now, The Mountain Eagle, Newspapers of New England and the Catskill Mountain Region Guide magazine. Several other media companies currently are in various stages of onboarding with the program, and they have indicated the program is beneficial to their future plans to fund local journalism. Current partners rave about the ability to rapidly begin this program in their markets. As one publisher stated: “It’s not reinventing the wheel; the program already exists and is successful.” The past year has been incredibly challenging for restaurants. The lockdown has forced many to close their doors (some permanently). “Restaurants need our support right now, and this new program will help those who live in these communities to show their support by going online and ordering take-out from their favorite restaurants,” said Mark Vinciguerra, Local Eats & Essential partner. “This program is unique because unlike other expensive online ordering programs, Local Eats is entirely free for the restaurant.” Local Eats & Essentials helps promote the program to local consumers using print, social and digital advertising and a marketing program that supports local journalism – in collaboration with its media partners. “We are thrilled to be part of this program and are always looking for new ways to support local restaurants and local businesses in our community. We’re looking forward to making it easier for restaurants in our community to get more online orders without paying the big fees,” said Doug La Rocque, publisher of Eastwick Press, one of the media companies involved. “We feel partnering with Local Eats & Essentials provides the e-commerce platform our Facebook page can use, and the mission of supporting local restaurants and journalism is a major benefit as well.” Local Eats & Essentials partners encourage communities to support the program and their local restaurants. To learn more and to order take-out, go to www.localeatsandessentials.com. # # # About Local Eats & Essentials: Local Eats & Essentials is an online takeout service that makes it easy to order from more than one restaurant in your community at a time. The program is free for restaurants, and customers pay a nominal local restaurant support fee (between $1 and $5) depending on the size of their orders.

Andrew Cuomo to immediately cease his recent practice of closing all of his public appearances to the press. This practice is an affront to the public that the governor serves; that public is represented by journalists when they are covering the activities of elected officials. Since allegations of sexual misconduct became public in late February, the governor has held numerous public events in which he has made announcements around the state, but he has refused to allow journalists to attend any of them. The effect has been that the governor has not had to answer questions from journalists in person. The governor has cited COVID-19 restrictions as reason for many, but not all, of these events being closed to the press. Most have been held in large facilities or outdoors where social distancing protocols could easily be followed by journalists, just as they were by the invited guests who have attended. We are taken aback that New York journalists who have been on the front lines covering COVID-19 for a year and cover communities across the state have seen their access curtailed. In addition, COVID-19 case levels are much lower than where they were in the spring and fall of 2020, when the governor still held in-person press conferences and most public events were open to the news media. With vaccinations now available to all New York adults, most journalists also are now vaccinated, providing an additional layer of protection. The governor's attempts to assuage journalists' concerns about this lack of access by holding occasional conference calls are woefully inadequate. The number of questions reporters can ask during these calls is severely limited, the governor or his staff choose the reporters given the opportunity to ask the questions, and there is typically no opportunity for follow-up questions. These restricted-access events are a blatant misuse of taxpayer dollars in an attempt to bolster the governor's image while at the same time attacking the public's right to know about the activities of government, a right that is exercised by the news media when covering the governor's public events in person. No governor should refuse to provide this basic level of access and transparency. As an organization representing hundreds of journalists in New York state, we call upon the governor to restore full press access to his events and to reinstate in-person press conferences. The Journalists Association of New York, formerly known as the New York State Associated Press Association, is a nonprofit organization overseen by a board of directors representing broadcast, digital, print and academic journalism organizations throughout New York state.

As currently drafted, the bill would curtail the availability of accurate news in many areas of the state and invite litigation to defend against government actions that would suppress distribution of news via newspapers. This legislation also unfairly forces newspapers to share the costs incurred by single stream municipal recycling programs and the negative effect of comingled plastic on the market for recovered paper. The newspapers of New York State have long supported the recycling and reuse of newsprint. More than 30 years ago, our association engaged in a cooperative agreement with the administration of Governor Mario Cuomo to encourage newsprint recycling. Today, more than 64% of old newspapers are recycled into products including home insulation, egg cartons, cereal boxes and eco-friendly cat litter (Yesterday’s News is made by Purina, a company with US manufacturing facilities). Newsprint is compostable and eco-friendly. Inks are non-toxic. Newsprint can be safely used as garden mulch, and old newspaper completely biodegrades in two to six months. This legislation is an attempt to shift the cost of municipal recycling programs onto highly recyclable products, such products as newspapers and magazines, which represent a small percentage of the municipal waste stream, 1.7 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, according to the EPA (Nondurable Goods: Product-Specific Data | Facts and Figures about Materials, Waste and Recycling | US EPA). The loss of markets for recyclable waste followed China’s 2018 decision to stop importing most US waste. Previously healthy markets for clean waste paper were damaged when paper was comingled with other materials. China’s purchase of recovered paper was decreased by about 30% due to contamination issues. An article in Yale Environment 360 makes clear where the responsibility lies: “China’s action came after many recycling programs had transitioned from requiring consumers to separate paper, plastics, cans, and bottles to today’s more common “single stream,” where it all goes into the same blue bin. As a result, contamination from food and waste has risen, leaving significant amounts unusable. In addition, plastic packaging has become increasingly complex, with colors, additives, and multilayer, mixed compositions making it ever more difficult to recycle. “ Piling Up: How China’s Ban on Importing Waste Has Stalled Global Recycling - Yale E360 Newspaper recycling has been a success story and might have continued to pay for itself absent adoption of single stream collection. This legislation would impose costs on newspapers in an attempt to cope with problems created by others. Newspaper revenues are not elastic, especially in the COVID era. Most newspaper revenue is derived from advertising, and even before COVID, more than half of ad revenues had migrated to the cheap, unregulated and personally targeted environments of Google and Facebook. In the era of COVID, local restaurants, shops and event spaces are closed or suffering extreme financial hardship and can’t afford to advertise. Many newspapers have extended free or deeply discounted advertising to their local businesses in order to help them survive. The cost of newsprint is a newspaper’s second largest expense (personnel is the largest) and there is little competition to keep that cost affordable. The number of newsprint mills has dwindled to a handful in recent years, and nearly all are in Canada. Newspapers simply cannot “find” additional funding except through staff or distribution cuts. The legislation would incentivize urban and suburban newspapers to shut down their presses, converting entirely to digital delivery. Pressroom jobs would be eliminated. The threshold contained in the legislation would capture even the smallest newspapers. Many smaller community newspapers in New York State are owned by families who publish a number of newspapers and would therefore reach the threshold for regulation under this bill. Even the smallest weekly and free papers would be affected, as they are printed by commercial printers , which would pass along the compliance costs. Home delivery in rural communities is accomplished by local delivery contractors or the US Postal Service. Fees on printed newspapers would have to be managed by curtailing distribution to the most rural locations. A rural printed newspaper provides news about food pantries, volunteer fire department fundraisers and town board meetings that is unavailable in any other media. Rural small businesses and local residents rely on classified and small-space ads in local newspapers to sell goods and services. The bill exempts standalone retailers from participation in collection requirements, but not coffee shops and diners, which will discourage those local community gathering spots from selling newspapers. The distribution of newspapers has for 300 years been considered a public good, worthy of citizen and government support and even some cost subsidization. Benjamin Franklin founded the US Postal Service in order to ensure the delivery of newspapers, and “bind the nation together.”. Newspapers are entitled to special discounted mailing rates in order to support distribution to all homes, no matter how remote. This legislation turns that founding philosophy on its head, proposing that newspapers should face government-imposed fees that are not imposed on electronic media. In doing so, the legislature would unfairly burden residents who live in rural areas or who do not have access to broadband internet. Many seniors prefer to receive their news on paper, and this legislation could deprive them on the right to receive news in the format they prefer. Further, this bill poses serious First Amendment issues. It authorizes the government to regulate and discourage delivery of news to citizens based on the format on which it is provided. It provides an avenue for government to assess costs on newspapers that could be adjusted in order to be punitive or restrictive, should government officials wish to retaliate for unfavorable coverage. It may look like a fee but is actually a tax on citizens’ right to receive information. It enacts a governmental preference for one type of news media (radio, social media and broadcast TV) over others (newspapers and magazines). It also includes imposition of a consumer education program. Legislation which grants government the right to compel publication of government messages is a violation of the First Amendment protection of freedom of the press. (Miami Herald v. Tornillo, Washington Post v. McManus) For these reasons, we urge Senator Kaminsky and Assm. Englebright to amend their legislation to exempt newspapers and magazines, and to pursue other avenues to revitalize the markets for recyclable and compostable materials that previously existed.
