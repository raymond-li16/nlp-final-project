 20 families displaced after fire at Crossroads Manor apartments in Lakewood Mike Davis Asbury Park Press LAKEWOOD - Twenty families were displaced after an apartment fire raged through nine units in the Crossroads Manor apartments Saturday afternoon, officials said.  The cause and investigation of the fire, which was reported at 1:17 p.m., are still under investigation by the Ocean County Fire Marshall's Office, Lakewood Fire Department Chief Jonathan Yahr said.  Four of the units were destroyed by fire, Yahr said. The other five sustained enough water or smoke damage that the Lakewood building department deemed them uninhabitable for the time being, he said.  The New Jersey chapter of the American Red Cross set up a temporary shelter at Lakewood High School for families displaced by the fire, officials said in a tweet. No firefighters or civilians were injured in the fire, Yahr said.  Editor's note: This story has been updated to accurately identify the name of the Crossroads Manor Apartments.
