OOPERSTOWN — Bassett Healthcare Network has begun offering COVID-19 vaccines to everyone 5 and older. Vaccines are available for children ages 5 to 11 in pediatric clinics and school-based health centers across the region. Parents may make appointments by calling their child’s practitioner. According to a media release, patients ages 5 to 11 will receive the Pfizer vaccine in two doses, three weeks apart, the same as older children and adults. However, the dose they will receive is 10 micrograms instead of the 30 micrograms given to patients 12 and older. “We’ve been waiting for this moment,” Bassett Healthcare Network Chief of Pediatrics Dr. Monica Brane said. “Finally, our children have a safe and effective vaccine to help protect them and their loved ones against COVID-19. She went on to add that “As a mother, as a doctor, and as a community member, I know that getting our kids vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do right now to take another major step towards beating this pandemic. Please make an appointment with your child’s practitioner today — as soon as possible — to get their COVID-19 shot. It’s one of the most incredible gifts we could ever hope for ahead of the holiday season.” As further stated in the release, COVID-19 booster shots are available at all Bassett clinic locations for eligible adults. Patients may qualify for a COVID-19 booster dose if they are 18 years or older, at least six months past their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and at least two months past their J&J dose.
