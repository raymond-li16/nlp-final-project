Open for business: City of Hartselle finds new home sweet home By Staff Reports Email the author Published 11:19 am Tuesday, November 30, 2021 The City of Hartselle has relocated its municipal offices from Sparkman Street to its new home at 611 Chestnut St. The move took place this past week, following the full remodel of the former Wells Fargo Bank building over the course of a little more than a year. The new 21,000 square-foot-space includes three levels and the large former bank vault, which will house city records in a secure, fireproof location. The first floor features a lobby with public restrooms, an auditorium that will be used for court and city council chambers and main city administrative offices. Additional private meeting rooms can be used by both court and city officials. The Hartselle City Council meetings will be held in the new assembly room. The city council meets the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month at 7 p.m. The public entrance to the new facility is located on the north side of the building on the first floor. The municipal building will be open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
