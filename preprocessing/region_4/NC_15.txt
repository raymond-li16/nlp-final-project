The city held its annual Christmas parade Saturday afternoon. This year's parade saw more than 100 entries float, walk and drive their way through downtown Kings Mountain. Highlights of the parade included Kings Mountain High School Marching Mountaineers, Catawba County Shrine Club’s Gator Patrol and the jolly ole elf himself, Santa Claus. Kings Mountain native and 96.9 Kat Country’s own Sarah Lee Owensby served as grand marshal.
