The program was funded by a grant from the Women’s Foundation of Alabama, investing over $6 million in initiatives, research, and policy to strengthen our community by building equitable opportunities for women. The program currently has a 95% pass rating. The Women’s Foundation of Alabama has also pledged additional funding for another class of candidates. Alicia Eldridge, Jakarya Johnson, Raven Manzie, Cordelia Jones, Ashiya Coleman and Sherry Scott are the first participants in the program. Jennifer Reynolds, Director of Student Success at WCCS, said the program put women drivers on the map. “This program is a game changer,” Reynolds said. “We’re excited for the women participating in our program.” WCCS Dean of Technical Programs and Workplace Development Raj Gourdine said State Senator Malika Sanders-Fortier played a key role in starting the program. Sanders-Fortier said she’s glad to see the women’s trucking program develop successfully. “We’re at a time where there’s a high demand for truck drivers and we’re excited for the women drivers,” Sanders-Fortier said. “My hope and vision for our area is having excellent education, employment and  entrepreneurship. Wallace Community College-Selma is providing that.”
