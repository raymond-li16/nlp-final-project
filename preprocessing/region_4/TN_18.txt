According to LPD, at approximately 7:30 a.m., a student made a report of observing another student in the high school parking lot with a gun. That information was immediately relayed to Sgt. Jeremy Laycock. At the time, Sgt. Laycock and SRO Jenna Roberts were on campus and in the student parking lot. At this point, the school went on lockdown. Sgt Laycock asked for additional LPD officers to respond, and in under 2 minutes, LPD had an additional five officers on campus, as well as deputies from Overton County Sheriff’s Department. Students that were still in the parking lot were asked to remain in their vehicles, and traffic coming in and out of Bradford-Hicks Drive was halted to secure the area.. Sgt Laycock located the suspect student within a few minutes, and the student was detained and searched for any weapons and none were found on his person. When asked about having a gun, the student immediately cooperated and advised he had a BB gun, which was a pistol style, in his vehicle, according to LPD. At this point, which was within 7 minutes of the initial report, the school went to a soft lockdown, with students and some of the parents dropping off being held in place until the BB gun was recovered from the vehicle. From the time of the initial report until the release of the parking lot was about 20 minutes. Police Chief Greg Etheredge stated, “The case is still under investigation by LPD, but there does not appear that the student had any malicious intent to cause harm.” Facebook Twitter Email Print Save MOST POPULAR  Articles Traffic stop leads to drug bust “BB gun” causes lockdown at Livingston Academy 25 years ago in Overton County News Gleason recorder indicted for theft Christmas in the Country begins TTU announces football facility upgrades Father, son charged with couple’s murder “Doctor Woman” became a legend on the Cumberland Plateau Christmas Parade to be held December 11 Lady Cats play for Thanksgiving tourney championship CALENDAR DECEMBER 2021 SunMonTueWedThuFriSat 1   2 3 4    5 6 7    8   9   10    11 12   13    14    15    16    17    18    19    20   21    22    23   24   25   262728293031 BrowseToday's events UPCOMING EVENTS DEC 6 Scrooge the Musical Mon, Dec 6, 2021 DEC 7 Scrooge the Musical Tue, Dec 7, 2021 DEC 7 Parkinsons Support Group Meeting Tue, Dec 7, 2021 DEC 7 Highway & County Property Meeting Tue, Dec 7, 2021 DEC 7 Public Safety Committee Tue, Dec 7, 2021 DEC 7 American Legion Auxiliary Meeting Tue, Dec 7, 2021 DEC 8 Scrooge the Musical Wed, Dec 8, 2021 DEC 8 Parent - Child Connection - Supporting your Partner Wed, Dec 8, 2021 DEC 9 Scrooge the Musical Thu, Dec 9, 2021 DEC 9 Christmas Business After Hours Thu, Dec 9, 2021 FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOLLOW US ON TWITTER STOCKS Market Data by TradingView SECTIONS News Sports Obituaries Online Features Weather SERVICES About Us Advertise Contact US Classifieds Email Alerts Place an Ad Calendar Search Subscription Services Submission Forms CONTACT INFORMATION overtoncountynews.com 415 West Main Street Livingston, TN 38570 Phone: 1-931-403-6397 Email: webeditor@overtoncountynews.com FOLLOW US    © Copyright 2021 Overton County News, 415 West Main Street Livingston, TN | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Powered by BLOX Content Management System from TownNews.com.
