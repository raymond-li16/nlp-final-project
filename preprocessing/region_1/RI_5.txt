The foundation in June also awarded $5.8 million to 77 local nonprofits. Champlin Executive Director Nina Stack said in a statement that organizations had to again navigate complexities due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic this year. However, Stack said she’s heartened by the efforts of state’s nonprofit community. “It is encouraging to see many returning to their important pre-pandemic capital priorities,” Stack said. “This past year has been one of innovation for so many organizations.” Out of the 126 organizations, 37 received grants of at least $100,000 and 17 were first-time grant recipients. The grants ranged from $2,071 to $1 million. The full list of grant recipients, and the amounts they received, can be found here. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County in Newport received the largest grant at $1 million. The youth services organization is planning to use that money to expand, renovate and restore its central clubhouse. The Miriam Hospital in Providence received $941,638 to purchase fluoroscopy equipment. The University of Rhode Island Foundation & Alumni Engagement received $563,706 for laser capture microdissection, laser doppler velocimetry and LED ellipsoidals and moving lights. The foundation will open up the application period for the 2022 first-round grants on Dec. 15 through Jan. 15.
