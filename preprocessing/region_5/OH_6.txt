Elyria student charged in Westwood threat (UPDATED) The Chronicle-Telegram Dec 06, 2021 6:33 AM Threatening social media posts against Elyria and Lorain schools have been traced to students. Sunday night, a Snapchat post read "THERE HAS BEEN A RUMOR THAT WESTWOOD MIDDLE SCHOOL. WMS IS ELYRIA OHIO WILL BE GETTING SHOT UP ON MONDAY DECEMBER 06TH STAY SAFE Y'ALL SEND TO ALL AND WILL POSTED SPREAD THE WORD." The post was reported by a student, who said it was made by a fake account pretending to be him. An investigation by Sheriff's Deputy Adam Shaw led to another student, who police said admitted sending the Snap. That student's parents said there was no access to weapons at their home. The student was charged with making terroristic threats, a third-degree felony, and first-degree misdemeanor charges of inducing panic and aggravated menacing. The student is in the Lorain County Juvenile Detention Home, and is awaiting a hearing in juvenile court. According to a robocall from Elyria schools spokeswoman Amy Higgins, there was increased law enforcement presence at Westwood on Monday as a result, and she urged parents to remain vigilant about any threats of violence. In a separate incident, a post on social media also led Lorain police to a student in that district. A parent notified Lorain Schools Sunday about a threat on Instagram. Lorain Police Sgt. Jake Morris said it appears to have been a misintepretation of a conversation. "A juvenile said something, but it wasn't necessarily a threat," Morris said. An investigation by Lorain police showed that no weapons were found in the student's home, and there is no threat to the schools currently. Morris said charges could be filed, and the matter remains under investigation.
