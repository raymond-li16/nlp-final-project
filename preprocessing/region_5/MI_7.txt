Richardson remodel complete Dec 1, 2021 Comments Richardson Chevrolet Remodel Facebook Twitter Email Print Save GLADWIN Richardson Chevrolet in Gladwin held a ribbon cutting event yesterday, Nov. 30, to officially announce the completion of their building renovations.  Alongside Richardson staff were members of FED Design/Builders who were contracted for the renovations, as well as Gladwin City Mayor, Dee Jungman and Gladwin City Manager, Chris Shannon.  The dealership broke ground on the remodel in late May 2021, and planned to be finished with the project by early fall.  “The delay came from supply shortages that are unfortunately very common at this time,”  Co-Vice President of the dealership, Evan Richardson said.  Even with the delay, the renovated business is finished just in time for the holiday traffic.  The remodel for the Chevrolet dealership is a complete top to bottom reconfiguration of the building, adding more space and modernizing features.  An entirely new roof has also been installed on the building in accordance with the structural changes.  “This was an opportunity for us to invest in our team members and staff as well as local workers,” Richardson said. “We’ve worked with FED before, and we are always looking to support a community that has been so supportive of us.” According to Richardson, his family has had their eye on a renovation since they purchased the business in April 2019.  The staff at Richardson Chevrolet are now proud to offer a larger and more comfortable building for customers, new and old.
