She is a registered member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, and has become a prominent artist in the public art world, both in Minneapolis and beyond. As a gallery director and artist, she is using her platform to produce beauty and healing, to encourage other Native American artists, and to help revitalize the Dakota language. Among the many public art projects Two Stars has completed is one that was installed recently in the Walker Art Center’s Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. To have her art to be included with the 40 other iconic works is a high honor.
