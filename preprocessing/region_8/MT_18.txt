Article Image Alt Text The Livingston Lariatâ€™s 4-H Club came to the assistance at the Chamber of Commerce the last two days to pack over 400 Christmas bags to be handed out to kids who visit Santa at the Livingston Christmas Stroll on Friday, Dec. 3. Santa will arrive at 5:30 p.m. on Main Street, setting up shop at Livingston Home Outfitters. The gift bags, which the kids are pictured packing on Tuesday evening, are comprised of many items, made possible by donated funds from community businesses and community members. Another 225 gift bags for seniors are also being packaged. Photo by Leslie Feigel
