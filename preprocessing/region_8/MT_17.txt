The Laurel High School musical “Beauty and the Beast” went off without a hitch last week. The 34 actors and vocalists had two public performances and additional shows for district elementary students. Artistic Director and Rhonda Burghardt and Technical Director Denise Hammer want to show their appreciation for every who helped make this year’s musical happen. The following is from the playbill for “Beauty and the Beast:” It takes a Great team to produce a Great show and we are very GRATEFUL for all those who contributed to the success of our production. Suzanne Purtee: It is a joy to have this accomplished pianist as our accompanist! Not only is she very talented, but she is so NICE and easy to work with! Linda Swensen: Creativity and skill abound when Linda is around! She can work wonders with a needle and fabric and is an incredible resource. While she did her usual magic with costumes, this year we also had costume help from Kimbree Garcia and the Campbell County High School; Gillette, Wyoming. Michael Hammer: Year after year Mike faithfully sets up the backdrop, builds and repairs set pieces and then tears it all down when the show is done. His construction skills are awesome and greatly appreciated! Sherry Sauskojus: Drawing and painting backdrops, making a library, creating pillars…. Sherry has contributed SO much to the set! We are indebted to her for her talent and the time she invested in our production. Others who helped create our amazing set were: Laura Yeager, Cindy Sampson, Michelle Mize, Maggie Swensen and many of the cast members. Lights and Sound are headed up by the very knowledgeable and helpful Mr. Elliot Cross. He is aided by his team in the booth: Sam Norman, Aiden Felker and Caleb Trostle. This is an invaluable job so thanks, guys, for makin gsure we can be seen and heard! Matt Kimmet’s class worked on the program and t–shirt designs. The winning contributions were made by Savannah Haug, Cam McAllister and Mason Mickelson. Laurel Public Library, Local Businesses who advertised, the Laurel Outlook and Brianna’s Bakes. LHS administration and teachers, technology, maintenance and housekeeping staff. We know our production creates mess and misses (of classes) so thanks for your patience and support. We believe theatre offers students an enriching opportunity they wouldn’t get elsewhere so thanks for making this possible. And FINALLY: a huge THANK YOU to all the FAMILIES of the cast and crew.
