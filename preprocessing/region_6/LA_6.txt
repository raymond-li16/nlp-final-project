Richwood Mayor Gerald Brown According to the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, if the recall passes, the mayoral office will be vacated upon the expiration of the time period for contesting the recall election or upon the final judgment becoming definitive.  The office would be filled in a special election, as in the case of ordinary vacancies and according to the constitution and laws of the state. Brown cannot be appointed or be a candidate in the special election to fill the vacancy.  If Brown's recall fails, no other recall for Brown can be held within 18 months from the date of his failed recall election.
