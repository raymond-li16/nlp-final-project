1st annual Turkey Traipse Around the Lake 5K Fun Run/Walk held Sara King editor@journalpilot.com Dec 3, 2021  Facebook Twitter Email 1 of 3 Facebook Twitter Email Print Save The 1st annual Turkey Traipse Around the Lake 5K Fun Run/Walk was held Thanksgiving morning at 8 a.m. with 125 participants braving the cold temperatures and joining in on a new turkey day tradition in Carthage. Runners and walkers alike took to the course which started at the Jaycee Park, went around the Carthage Lake, and came up Dallas Road before coming to the highway and back to Jaycee Park. Young and old alike participated, from Hancock County locals to visitors from afar. While there were no actual winners declared due to the 5K being a fun run/walk, the first three finishers received a free tea from Bold Nutrition. About two years ago, Keara Weber and Raigan Brown, started getting together to exercise regularly. Soon, their duo had moved to meeting at FOCUS Fitness in Carthage and grew in numbers, eventually being dubbed the 5AM Fit Club. In November 2019 an online community was formed on Facebook to help others find support in their health and wellness journey. “The clubs primary mission is the inspiration, motivation, and positive encouragement for anyone, whether they are just starting their fitness journey, or need help and motivation in continuing a healthy lifestyle,” Weber explained. Earlier this year, the group did a T-shirt fundraiser and donated the proceeds to FOCUS Fitness. When the group decided to bring a Thanksgiving 5K to Carthage, they once again decided to donate the proceeds to benefit a local group. “The Carthage Park District will receive the proceeds from this year’s Turkey Traipse as they have quite a few projects going and coming up that will really benefit the community,” Weber stated. The race was a big success and lots of fun, and the group hopes to continue to offer it each Thanksgiving in Carthage. Many local sponsors and businesses made this event possible.
