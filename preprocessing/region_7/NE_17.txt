Skip to main content site-logo FEATURED BREAKING TOPICAL Firefighters battle structure fire in Mitchell Jeff Van Patten Dec 6, 2021 Updated 4 hrs ago  0 1 of 2 Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Jeff Van Patten MITCHELL — A couple was displaced after an early morning fire Monday destroyed their home. The Mitchell Fire Department was called to a structure fire at 40330 Ninth Ave. at about 5:30 a.m. Scottsbluff Fire Department and Scottsbluff Rural Fire also responded, requested to provide mutual aid. Homeowner Robin Franco said she and her husband Ed Franco were staying at a motel in Morrill Sunday night because they had lost power to their home. They had been experiencing electrical problems prior to the blaze, she said. They had breakers that would constantly be tripped. Neighbors Stephen and Joleen Wetherington said neighbors spotted the fire and knocked on the door, but got no answer. After calling the Scotts Bluff County Communication Center, a sheriff’s deputy was able to reach the couple by phone. The Franco’s son Shayne Whitton said he had gotten a call from his stepbrother in Kansas with news of the fire. “It blows my mind. I was just getting off work (at the Wyoming Correctional Facility in Torrington),” he said at the scene of Monday’s fire. Support Local Journalism Your subscription makes our reporting possible. The fire was so intense, Whitton said he could see it from Highway 26 between Morrill and Mitchell. Whitton said he and his family are devastated by the blaze. “I grew up in this house,” he said. “It looks like a total loss to me. It was a beautiful home.” Three dogs that the couple had in the home escaped the fire. In addition to the three dogs, the couple also had a horse and pony. Shelter for the horses is being sought. Carissa Schank with Firefighter Ministry said she was able to assist the family with housing and food vouchers. The Nebraska State Fire Marshal’s Office has been dispatched.
