At camp, they spent some time refining their technique with the help of Nebraska's staff and they were able to build on their relationships with each other as well as with other wrestlers from across the country. “I received many positive comments from Nebraska's staff as well as from fellow coaches who were very impressed with the character of our team, which means a lot more to me than the wins and losses,” said Coach Wenger. “We are really looking forward to using our experiences at camp this summer to provide us with a springboard into what could be a very productive and much anticipated 2021-2022 wrestling season.
