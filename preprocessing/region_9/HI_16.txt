The decision will likely give the University of Hawaiʻi football team a bid to play Memphis in the EasyPost Hawaii Bowl on Christmas Eve. The new bowl game will be played somewhere in Texas and be televised on ESPN, according to McMurphy. Prior to the report, one bowl-eligible team was expected to not be invited to a bowl game. Despite a sub .500 season and rallying to a late 6-7 record, the Rainbow Warriors are expected to be the first and only team with a losing record to be invited to a bowl game this season. Under the NCAA criteria, they hold top priority over other teams with losing records, as they are the only team in the country to play 13 games to this point. This bowl bid comes at a rocky time for the ‘Bows as a recent Twitter Space conversation highlighted some player displeasure from the season. The team will be without a number of players who entered the transfer portal in the last two weeks, including quarterback Chevan Cordeiro and tailback Dae Dae Hunter. True freshman quarterback Brayden Schager will likely make his fourth start of the season.
