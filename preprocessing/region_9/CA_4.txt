Tips from the public helped detectives identify the suspect, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. On Thursday, San Mateo police officers arrested him on a $40,000 warrant in San Mateo. The sheriff’s office said the suspect was booked into Santa Clara County jail on charges of sexual battery and false imprisonment. The alleged crimes occurred on May 5. The victim was walking to her workplace in the area of North Stelling Road and Stevens Creek Boulevard when the suspect approached her and made “verbal flirtatious advances,” according to the sheriff’s office. The victim declined and continued to walk to her workplace. The sheriff’s office said the suspect later approached her in a parking lot, held her against her will and sexually assaulted her. A witness intervened and the suspect left the scene. On Nov. 8, the sheriff’s office released photographs and video surveillance footage of the suspect and his vehicle.
