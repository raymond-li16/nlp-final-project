Bolognini is a longtime telecommunications and cable executive whose career spans more than four decades. Under his leadership, Cox Las Vegas has grown to become one of Nevada’s largest, private, non-gaming employers with a statewide annual economic impact of $2.2 billion.   “Our position in the Las Vegas market is strong thanks to the leadership of Michael, his exceptional executive team and the 1,500 Cox Las Vegas employees,” said Percy Kirk, senior vice president and general manager of Cox’s Southwest region. “We’re thankful to Mike for his leadership and impact on the Southern Nevada community.” A search for Bolognini’s replacement is already underway with plans to announce his successor in early 2022, according to Kirk. Bolognini joined Cox in 2009 as vice president of Cox Business. He was named vice president and Las Vegas market leader in 2014 and led the company through significant technology and infrastructure investments in Southern Nevada. He championed employee volunteer initiatives and Cox Charities, the philanthropic arm of Cox Las Vegas, which has awarded more than $2.3 million in grants to local nonprofits since 2007. He is a member of the Vegas Chamber’s Executive Committee and past chairman who helped the Chamber focus on expanding its reach beyond Southern Nevada by engaging elected and other leaders in Washington, D.C. in support of key Nevada business initiatives. He is an active member of the board of directors of Foundation for an Independent Tomorrow (FIT) and Opportunity Village. He supports the Las Vegas Philharmonic as a member of its board of trustees and is on the board of trustees for Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit responsible for securing signature events to benefit the Las Vegas economy. Bolognini and his wife, Beverly, plan to remain in Southern Nevada.
