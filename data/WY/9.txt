CASPER – Four students from Niobrara County High School attended the North Platte District Honors Clinic activities in Casper. With a band ensemble of over 80 and a choir over 70, the strong musicianship and technical skills were represented with the students of the North Platte district which includes Wheatland, Lingle-Fort Laramie, Torrington, Guernsey-Sunrise, Niobrara County, Kelly Walsh, Glenrock, Douglas, and Natrona County. Students rehearsed prepared music for two days culminating in a performance on Tuesday afternoon.

The band was directed by Dr. Joseph Carver of the University of Wyoming. They played five selections ranging in diversity from a piece by Steven Reineke evoking a white water rafting trip down a river to a traditional Alfred Reed “Gallop from First Suite”. 

The choir was directed by Dr. Jonathan Nero. They too performed a diverse set of pieces with “He, Watching Over Israel,” to an African chant “Ukuthula,” to a swing Jazz number “Still I rise” by Powell and Powell. 

Camden Rose, a sophomore played trombone and Samuel Dalsbo, a senior played tenor saxophone. Haven Hendricks, a freshman and Sarah Daniels, a sophomore, sang Alto 1 and Soprano 2 respectively with the choir.
