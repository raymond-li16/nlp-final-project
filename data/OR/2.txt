MALHEUR COUNTY — The Malheur County Health Department reported this morning that six residents who were diagnosed with COVID-19 since Thanksgiving have died. One of these deaths was already reported by the department on Dec. 6, but was included in the most recent news release "since six in a week is a significant number," wrote Angie Sillonis, public information officer for the agency in an email that accompanied the release.

The health department says this brings the total deaths since August to 28 in Malheur County, with 92 overall since the onset of the pandemic in March of 2020.

Statistics for the five most recent deaths follow. The county's 88th death was a woman in her 70s who died in the hospital; the 89th death is a man in his 60s; the 90th is a man in his 80s, who died in the hospital; the 91st was a man in his 70s, who died at home; and the 92nd was a man in his 80s, who also died at home.

Individuals who need a COVID test are urged to utilize local providers’ clinics, pharmacies and doctor’s offices.

Malheur County Health Department, at 1108 S.W. Fourth St., will extend clinic hours, and offer walk-in vaccines for COVID-19, flu, and any other vaccine someone might need, from 1 to 6 p.m. every Wednesday in December, except the week of Christmas.

Additionally, a drive-through clinic is slated for Dec. 11 at the firehouse at the

Ontario Airport, 3288 S.W. Fourth Ave. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. that day, people will be able to receive both COVID-19 vaccines (including boosters or third doses) and flu vaccines on the same day.
