Evergreen Federal Bank is hosting its annual Rogue Winterfest at the Bear Hotel in Grants Pass to raise money for mental health.

Normally the event is a full gala, but for the second straight year, the event will be online due to the pandemic.

21 Christmas trees, â€¦put together by organizations as far away as Portland to be auctioned off.

This year being virtual, you can bid on a tree from home on December 2nd, with lots going on that evening.
