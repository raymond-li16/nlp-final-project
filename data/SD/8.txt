ABERDEEN — Huron put the first goal on the board, but it was all Aberdeen after that, as the Cougars handed the All-Stars a 7-1 setback during its season opener on Saturday.

Andrew Arteman had the lone goal for Huron with two minutes and 56 seconds off the clock in the first period. He scored on a pass from Connor McCloud.

Aberdeen would score four times before the end of the opening period to carry a 4-1 victory into the second period.

The Cougars then added three goals in the second period and both teams went scoreless in the final period.

The All-Stars managed just seven shots on goal in the game, while Aberdeen tallied 43. Cooper Letcher had 36 saves as the goalie for Huron.

The All-Stars faced Oahe at Bergman Arena on Sunday, but results from that game were not available at press time.

Huron is now off until Dec. 17, when it hosts Sioux Falls 2 at Bergman Arena.
