It was bound be bet cold sooner or later, and "later" came Monday morning, Dec. 6 as dawn broke with single digits. By 10:30 a.m. it was 11 degrees according to the clock at CorTrust Bank, but don't expect it to get a whole lot warmer today. While highs aren't expected to reach 30 degrees, Monday will be the coldest day of the week, with a return to the 40s mid-week.
