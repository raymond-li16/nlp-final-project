Alexander’s family first heard news of the actress’ friend being shot, but when they tried to reach her, they knew something was wrong.

“So when I got the phone call (confirming her death), I just dropped to my knees. I didn’t know what to think,” Shelley Alexender, Jonshel’s mother, told 4WWL News.

Jonshel’s father, Johnny Alexander, found out about his daughter’s death at work.

“Right then and there I just froze,” he told the outlet. “I just stood still for like two hours. I couldn’t do anything. Because that was my baby girl.”

“I’m going to miss her so much,” Jonshel’s friend Terryal Rogers said. “She was everything to us. She was like that missing puzzle that in our gang that we needed.”

Jonshel leaves behind a one-year-old daughter.

Alexander landed the role of “Joy Strong” at the age of 12, beating out 4,000 other Louisiana natives in the Benh Zeitlin-directed film. She starred alongside Quvenzhané Wallis. The film went on to win at the Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals, and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
