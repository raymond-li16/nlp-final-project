Among the many volunteers assisting in the 2021 local Toys for Tots drive were a number of members of the East Coweta High School Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). The funds raised through donations of cash and toys will help to provide Christmas gifts for 6,000 local children in the local counties of Coweta, Fayette, Heard, and Meriwether. The last weekend for the local drive will be Saturday and Sunday, December 11 and 12. Tables at local Walmarts will be open both days from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Among the ECHS JROTC students helping to man tables at local Walmarts were (L-R) Ruben Johnson, Sarah Meacham, Abe Gunby, and Tyler Mullet.
