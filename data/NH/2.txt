YORK, Maine – Hundreds of people gathered Saturday, Dec. 4, to watch a parade of marching bands, more than 40 floats, antique cars, public service organizations and business establishments for the town's annual celebration of the season.

Attendees draped themselves in holiday string lights and donned their best Christmas sweaters and red hats as children grew animated at the sight of elaborately decorated floats that lit up the night sky.

Anxious children ran up York Street toward the Village to make sure they would catch glimpses of holiday icons walking in the parade, such as the Grinch, Mr. and Mrs. Claus and numerous others. 

Plenty to do:No ceremony for Lighting of the Nubble, but plenty to keep York holidays bright in 2021

The York Wildcats Marching Band filled the atmosphere with festive music for the occasion.

The parade, which was canceled last year, began at Foster’s Clambake on Axholme Road at 4:30 p.m. and ended at Village Elementary School. The parade was canceled in 2020 because only a few floats signed up to participate, Cooper said at the time, adding that it was likely a result of people's concerns over COVID-19.
