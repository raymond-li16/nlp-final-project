Lee Enterprises last week sued the Montana Public Service Commission alleging the agency set excessive costs and hurdles for public records requests that violated the state's open records laws.

The petition, filed Dec. 3 in Lewis and Clark County District Court, raises three instances in which Lee Enterprises' reporters sought PSC records and were met with up-front costs, in one case $31,000, and legal reviews before the documents would be disclosed.

A spokesperson for the PSC said the agency had not yet been served with the filing and had no comment Monday.

Lee Enterprises is the parent company of several  Montana newspapers, including the Helena Independent Record, Billings Gazette, Missoulian, Montana Standard (Butte) and Ravalli Republic in Hamilton.

The lawsuit challenges the costs the PSC has assigned to fulfilling the records requests and argues the costs of "legal review" of documents prior to their disclosure is not authorized in the Montana Open Records Act. Such costs, the filing states, has a chilling effect on the public right to examine government documents enshrined in the constitution.
