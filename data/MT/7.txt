Staking decorations down
Choteau homeowner Gary Simonson was out on Monday staking down his Christmas yard ornaments as gusty winds pummeled the Rocky Mountain Front. The mild, albeit windy, weather gave Choteau residents time over the Thanksgiving holiday to get their Christmas lights and decorations put out in shirt-sleeves weather. The Choteau Chamber of Commerce judges will pick the top three home/yard decorators the week before Christmas and will award $100, $75 and $50 in Choteau Bucks to the first-, second- and third-place winners.
