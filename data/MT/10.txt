A Charlo woman died in a traffic crash near Libby when her vehicle struck a moose.

According to Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Noah Pesola, the 67-year-old woman was driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek west on U.S. 2 in Lincoln County at about 5:37 p.m. Friday near milemaker 64.

A moose entered the roadway and the vehicle struck it, causing heavy damage to the front of the car. The car then veered off to the left and came to rest in some trees.

The woman was taken to Logan Health in Kalispell where she later died of her injuries.

The woman was wearing a seat belt. Neither alcohol, drugs nor speed were suspected factors in the crash.
