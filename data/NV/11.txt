Snow covers Northern Nevada on Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2021.
Winter weather is back.

After an extended stretch of above-average temperatures and extremely dry conditions, a series of storms is moving into the region this week.

A weak system will bring rain to lower elevations and light snowfall to mountain passes tonight from the I-80 area south to Mono and Alpine counties. The best chance for precipitation is south of Hwy. 50, with 1 to 4 inches of snow possible at higher elevations.

Slick driving conditions are expected on mountain passes and U.S. 395 in Mono County.

Temperatures in Reno will hover in the mid-50s until a larger and colder system moves into the area Wednesday and Thursday, bringing snow down to the valley floor.

There is a 70 percent chance of snow accumulating at all elevations during the mid-week storm, with Reno seeing anywhere from a trace to 4 inches, according to the National Weather Service. The Sierra could see anywhere from a few inches to a foot of snow.

Temperatures in Reno will peak in the mid-30s Friday and brisk northwest winds of 15 to 25 mph will drop temperatures even farther.

Overnight temperatures Friday will drop into the single digits, with sub-zero temperatures possible in some valleys.

A third winter storm is possible for late in the weekend or early next week.
