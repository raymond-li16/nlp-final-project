ELLSWORTH — A driver operating a 2007 Dodge Nitro pulled out of Card Enterprises on Bangor Road and struck a northbound 2005 Subaru Forester shortly after 2 p.m. Monday.

The Nitro, driven by 31-year-old Molly Riddle of Ellsworth, ended up on its side. The Forester, driven by Larry DeWitt, 68, also of Ellsworth, was left disabled in the middle of Bangor Road.

The only injuries were minor cuts and scrapes, Ellsworth Police Sgt. Chad Wilmot said.

The 911 call came in at 2:24 p.m., and the accident was cleared at 3:14, Wilmot said.

Southbound traffic was diverted down Christian Ridge Road, while northbound traffic was funneled through the scene, to keep traffic moving.

The Nitro had temporary plates attached, and Wilmot noted it appeared to have been recently purchased.

First responders, including the Ellsworth Fire Department and Hancock County Sheriff’s deputies, assisted at the scene.
