YORK, Maine – York Ready for Climate Action is the new name of the three-year-old organization that has been known as York Ready for 100%.

The name change indicates the organization’s growth, outreach and determination to make a positive difference in the health and well-being of the Town of York, other towns in southern Maine and the State as everyone faces climate change and its effects.

The organization’s mission remains the same: “York Ready for Climate Action is a grassroots organization dedicated to building sustainability and reducing the causes of climate change and its effects on humans and the natural world.”

YRFCA Chair Mac McAbee said the group welcomes new colleagues and looks forward to greater outreach, more public events and helping York achieve the goals of its Climate Action Plan.
