The investigation by the Maine State Police indicates the vehicle, either a minivan or a sport utility vehicle, was southbound when it crashed into a guardrail, redirected back onto the highway and then struck the center pylon at the toll plaza, causing the vehicle to burst into flames.

The vehicle’s sole occupant — now identified as Yurchick — was declared dead at the scene. The cause and manner of Yurchick’s death are pending further studies at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner.
