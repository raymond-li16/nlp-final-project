Joyce Burge Morgan has been chosen as the Linden Christmas Parade of Lights Grand Marshall.

The Christmas Parade of Lights Grand Marshall this year is Joyce Burge Morgan! Mrs. Morgan graduated Demopolis High School in 1969, and earned a certificate in Accounting from Richmond P. Hobson State Technical School in Thomasville which is now known as Coastal Community College.

She has been married to Alfred K. Morgan for fifty one years. They have three sons, nine grandchildren, and one great granddaughter. Before she started a family, she worked at First Bank of Linden for two and a half years. Mrs. Morgan then worked for the Marengo County Library System for twenty eight years where she drove the bookmobile for five years before becoming the Library Director. As the Director, the Library grew to what we all know it as today, and the citizens of Linden and Marengo appreciate her many years of dedication and service.
