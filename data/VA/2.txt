A Chesterfield man pleadded guilty in Louisa Circuit Court to one count of assault and battery in a case that began with charges of three counts of felony sexual assault.

Peter Schultz, who was 18 at the time of the May 2019 incident at a Lake Anna house, was sentenced on Nov. 24 to one year of suspended jail time on the misdemeanor charge. That charge was an amendment of one of the three original felony counts; the other two charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement.

Schultz was arrested in January 2020 after the Louisa County Commonwealth’s Attorney accused him of assaulting a woman at his parents’ house during a party on May 1, 2019.

Schultz was indicted by a grand jury in March 2020 after prosecutors found texts on the victim’s phone from Schultz about the incident. In addition, a witness who is related to the victim had testified at an earlier court hearing that he warned Schultz not to go into a bedroom with the victim. The witness said the victim had been drinking vodka and was too drunk to make decisions for herself.

Schultz and the victim were in a romantic relationship, according to the witness.

Dear readers, this Thanksgiving I was grateful to pull my hiking boots out of the closet and put them on. Sounds a bit strange, you say? Well, in the immortal words of Paul Harvey, here’s “the rest of the story.” Read more

Most of the leaves have fallen, the sun angle is low and with recent fronts coming through mostly dry and often overnight, passive solar heating season has fully arrived at my house. My south-facing wall, mostly glass, allows the sun to shine deep into the house, quickly removing any early morning chill. Being retired makes it easier to sleep in, and wait for the house to warm.

For some months now we’ve been told to Christmas-shop even earlier than usual, as all those container ships are wandering about the near Pacific waiting to magically unload our gifts into those driverless big rigs parked in some unknown distant lot, for without those gifts Big Business says our holidays will be bleak and joyless. Children hear and weep, grownups grow restless and look at each other in uneasy guilt. A tradition is broken, a crucial rite unobserved. A great sense of self-reproach lies deep in the heart of the land. We must buy Stuff for Christmas. Read more

 Due to Covid, my mother, sisters and I hadn’t seen each other in over two years. That is a looooooong time! So recently we all converged at Mom’s house for several days. We had a lot of time to make up! Fun question: How do you celebrate four holidays in less than a week? Well dear readers, I’m here to tell you all about it. Buckle your seatbelts for a wild and fun ride! Read more

About two generations back, nearly every male would be looking forward to Opening Day in November.  The primary hunting season ran from late that month to late January, and the opening and closing days might as well have been school holidays, so many fellows were “sick.” Read more

After the instant relief delivered by last week’s cold front and the first day of fall actually feeling like fall, I’d almost forgotten that Earth has just experienced another sweltering, record-smashing summer and how long it had been since any northern air had made it this far south – very early August.

Recently I visited Bracketts Farm in the Green Springs National Landmark District. It’s located just north of Zion Crossroads, off of Route 15. They were having an “open farm” day, so we loaded up a couple of cars with some friends and off we went. And let me tell you, dear readers, we had an awesome visit! Read more

In my youth, this was the month college students returned to their dorms for another year of spartan living. My college was all-male, which probably accounted for much of its plainness. The double rooms came with two desks, two chairs, and two cots or a bunk bed.  Read more
