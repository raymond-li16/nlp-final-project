A Chesterfield man pleadded guilty in Louisa Circuit Court to one count of assault and battery in a case that began with charges of three counts of felony sexual assault.

Peter Schultz, who was 18 at the time of the May 2019 incident at a Lake Anna house, was sentenced on Nov. 24 to one year of suspended jail time on the misdemeanor charge. That charge was an amendment of one of the three original felony counts; the other two charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement.

Schultz was arrested in January 2020 after the Louisa County Commonwealth’s Attorney accused him of assaulting a woman at his parents’ house during a party on May 1, 2019.

Schultz was indicted by a grand jury in March 2020 after prosecutors found texts on the victim’s phone from Schultz about the incident. In addition, a witness who is related to the victim had testified at an earlier court hearing that he warned Schultz not to go into a bedroom with the victim. The witness said the victim had been drinking vodka and was too drunk to make decisions for herself.

Schultz and the victim were in a romantic relationship, according to the witness.
