Emergency service workers in King William County are facing exhaustion, manpower issues, and are relying on neighboring areas for cover as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic takes its toll, according to the fire chief.

Fire Chief Stacy Reaves detailed the acute pressures the EMS service and local hospitals are under in a report to the King William Board of Supervisors on Nov. 8.

He said while COVID-19 cases are falling in the area, the region is “continuously in Status Black” which requires the Richmond-based VCU Health System to determine ambulance destinations. Status Black involves hospitals deferring non-emergency surgeries due to a shortage of beds. This means EMS services have to call a hotline to access hospitals with available spaces resulting in longer transportation times, Reaves said.

“We have had to call on our neighbors multiple times this past month, King and Queen. We have had to ask West Point to come up in the upper part of the county several times. I know they are part of us but the last choice should be to extend that resource because it leaves the entire town of West Point open,” Reaves told the board.

Although COVID cases are declining, the problems have been exacerbated by the saturation of local hospitals and the shortage of workers in the health care industry, according to Reaves.

“Hospitals are suffering probably worse than we are now … across the board of the emergency services and the emergency hospital departments, we are exhausted,” Reaves said.

“The people who were healthy who were able to come and work they’re getting beat up. … Unfortunately, people seem to be pulling away, for better opportunities, a safer environment and so on and so forth.

“That’s what’s driving the Code Black right now. It’s not that the COVID patients are at their peak. It’s that the peak of COVID patients and all of the other issues we have across the board are wearing everybody out,” he said.

Reaves said applications for seven open positions in the fire and EMS Department are being progressed. Recruits will have to reimburse the county for their training costs if they leave.

The fire chief said the county’s third ambulance is out of service because it would not pass a state inspection.

“Due to the dollar amount of repairs needed, it will remain out of service and unrepaired,” Reaves said in his report to the board. A new ambulance is expected to come into service by the end of the year. Reaves detailed an electrical issue with a second ambulance which was being addressed.
