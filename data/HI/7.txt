A one-day tour to Lanai will be launched possibly in May for visitors to learn more about the cultural, historical and ecological aspects of the island and volunteer in a service activity before they leave.

Visitors will also go to Lanai City for lunch along with “strolling and shopping” of the businesses there.

The program is one of the initiatives that have come out of the Destination Management Action Plan for Lanai. Updates from the plan were shared at a virtual meeting Thursday morning. Another meeting was scheduled for Thursday evening.

Meagan DeGaia, destination manager at the Maui Visitors & Convention Bureau, said they are aiming to get the one-day tour up in May and have it take place quarterly.

Discussions are taking place among Trilogy’s Blue ‘Aina Program, Pulama Lana’i and Expeditions Ferry to establish the program.

Other actions that have arisen from the plan include establishing a QR code for visitors to scan, which would inform them of Lanai business hours and other information.

At the meeting, officials also announced the creation of a Lanai Advisory Board, which includes 16 members of the community and businesses that will help guide the messaging and campaigns to develop a unique brand for Lanai City.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority published the 2021-2023 Maui Nui Destination Management Action Plan in March. It is part of HTA’s strategic vision and continuing efforts to manage tourism in a responsible and regenerative manner, according to HTA. The plan was developed by the residents of Maui, Molokai and Lanai and in partnership with Maui County and the Maui Visitors Bureau.
