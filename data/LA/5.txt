On Tuesday, parents of students who attend the French Immersion program in Lincoln Parish received a letter saying that the program will not continue next school year.

The letter was addressed from Corinne Nuit, world language supervisor for Lincoln Parish Schools.

"The program will close its doors at the end of this school year," the letter reads. "The decision was made based on a number of outside factors."

The letter did not say what any of those factors are.

The program, previously called Foreign Language Academic Immersion on the Rise, runs as part of Glen View Elementary, and parents have the option to enroll their kids in the program voluntarily.

Lincoln Parish Superintendent Ricky Durrett declined to comment on the matter and has instead said he will address parent concerns at a Q&A event next week.

That meeting is scheduled for Dec. 9 at 5 p.m. in the Glen View Elementary gymnasium, 1601 Bittersweet Ave., Ruston. The event is open to the public.

According to FLAIR's website, the program lasts from grades kindergarten through second, and a new grade was scheduled to be added at Cypress Springs in 2022.

Rachel Shamburger Daniel said her kids, who are adopted from the foster care system, have experienced extreme trauma. When the traditional public classroom didn't work, the French Immersion program did.

"Three of my kids are committed to fifth grade to do French immersion, and the effects of not having it will absolutely be devastating," Daniel said. "Because regular classroom learning, especially for trauma kids, is not going to be an option for us."
