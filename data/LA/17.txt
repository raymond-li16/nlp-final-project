A co-working space has opened on the North Shore, where options for the service are slim.

The Park Executive Office Suites in the NorthPark One building at 106 Park Place Drive in Covington offers tenants their own private offices. The 4,800-square-foot space offers offices ranging from 90 square feet to 220 square feet.

Rates range from $750 to $1,350 per month, depending on size, and terms are for a minimum of six months. Suites are arranged around the exterior of the building, and amenities at the site include a lounge, kitchen free espresso printing and copying and conference rooms.

There are also three hours of conference room use included and additional hours at a rate of $20 to $35 per hour for members and $40 to $65 per hour for nonmembers. One conference room can seat four to six people, and the larger one can fit 10 people.

The Park founder and owner David Skansi said current tenants at the site include individuals who work in social media and marketing, finance and the marine industry.

Prior to creating the co-working space, Skansi said an oilfield company rented a portion of it but he didn’t find much interest from other tenants over a two-year period. He then decided to break up the space into smaller offices.

There wasn’t much demand when the space opened in April due to COVID-19 concerns, but it has picked up as the year went on, he said. Occupancy at The Park now stands at 70%, he said.

Co-working spaces have become popular in recent years for small businesses and entrepreneurs looking for an alternative to traditional office space or working from home. Many find the flexibility and shorter lease terms attractive.

Multiple co-working spaces have sprung up in New Orleans such as The Shop at the CAC, The Warehouse at 3014 Dauphine St. and Connect Hub Coworking at 400 Poydras Tower in the Central Business District, which occupies the space left vacant by Launch Pad, another co-working tenant that moved out in 2020.

But co-working options are few and far between on the North Shore. Skansi said the closest may be a co-working space in Hammond that’s connected with Southeastern Louisiana University.

“I haven’t really seen anything like that on the North Shore,” he said.

St. Tammany Corporation noted the lack of space in its “Thrive 2023” five-year economic development strategic plan, adopted in February 2019. It pointed to the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub, an organization that created a workspace for entrepreneurs, artists and designers in Little Rock.

“The St. Tammany Corporation should work with local leaders and organizations dedicated to small business to explore opportunities for co-working spaces, business formation programs and maker spaces,” the report said.

There are currently more than 8,400 establishments in the parish, of which roughly two-thirds are likely to be small businesses of less than 100 employees, the report said. And around 9.3% of the population is self-employed, it said.

“Given the existing commercial properties available, no new space should be built but rather retrofitting of an existing location,” it said. “In addition, there are immediate business formation opportunities that can be leveraged based on the growth in the market including health care and the outdoor lifestyle amenities that residents are coming to the parish to enjoy.”
