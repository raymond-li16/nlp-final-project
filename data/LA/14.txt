A Houston River Baptist Church tradition is back. HRBC Media Director Peyton Robertson said Journey to Bethlehem, a live-action, walk-through experience with 35 church members participating and playing multiple characters at 20 stations “is much more than the usual live nativity scene.”

He invited the public to attend to feel like they were actually there. Performances are Friday, Dec. 10, Saturday, Dec. 11 and Sunday, Dec. 12 at 6 p.m. Admission and the hot chocolate are free.

“It’s a great family activity,” said Margaret Schreve, children’s minister. “Grandparents, parents and kids can experience the Christmas story almost as if you were back in Bethlehem.”

Backdrops reflect village scenes. Actors, including angels will be costumed. Live animals will come as they are.

“Attendees will get to see an actual cloth weaver and hear the Biblical stories about the seller of cloth. They can visit with the bread maker and at the potter’s house they will learn an interesting story about how God sent Jeremiah to the potter’s house,” Schreve said.

The event opens with the first scene of a family reading the Christmas story. Guides will walk groups through the different vignettes, give the general background for each scene and refer to certain scriptures.

“Our world is so full of fear, hate and despair, especially now,” Schreve said. “When we experience the Christmas story, it is a reminder that He came to give us hope, to give us salvation. He changed death to life.”

Houston River Baptist Church is located at 110 W. Houston River Road in Sulphur. To find out more, call (337) 527-5725.
