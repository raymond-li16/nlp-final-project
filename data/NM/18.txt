A 38-year-old man who allegedly shot and killed a 25-year-old on Dea Lane in Taos last Thursday (Dec. 2) turned himself in to authorities shortly after the incident, a statement of probable cause filed in Taos Magistrate Court reveals.

Ray Rivera, who has been charged with first-degree murder, allegedly shot and killed Antonio Martinez after a night of drinking and doing cocaine with three other individuals at a warehouse on Dea Lane. Rivera said his intention was to pistol whip Martinez after the two got into a fight, according to the court filing. Instead, he said he shot Martinez in the head by accident, killing him.

According to the statement of probable cause, Rivera left the warehouse after an initial altercation with Martinez Thursday night, later returning with his brother and a Hi Point 380-caliber handgun. As he entered the warehouse, Martinez and others allegedly tried to stop him, but Rivera and his brother made their way inside.

One of the other men who was present during the fight, Bryan Sandoval, allegedly tried to hold Rivera back and take the gun from him, but Rivera got loose. Shortly after wrestling himself away from Sandoval, a shot rang out. Three of the four individuals, including Rivera, confirmed this account, though Rivera said he did not have the gun pointed at Martinez when the gun fired.

Two of the other witnesses told authorities they saw Rivera’s arm holding the gun and make a motion toward Martinez. Another individual said he didn’t see the actual incident and didn’t hear the gunshot due to loud music that was playing during the fight.

Rivera is currently being held at the Taos County Adult Detention Center. The state has filed a motion for pre-trial detention, claiming Rivera would be a danger to the community if released.

Rivera will appear before 8th Judicial District Judge Jeffrey Shannon on Dec. 10 for a preliminary hearing and a pre-trial detention hearing.

This is a developing story.
