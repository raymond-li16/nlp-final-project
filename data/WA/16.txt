EVERETT — Cold-case defendant William Talbott’s aggravated murder convictions were reversed Monday on appeal due to a juror’s bias, more than two years after a high-profile trial in the 1987 killings of a young Canadian couple, Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg.

Snohomish County sheriff’s detectives arrested Talbott in May 2018, with the help of forensic genealogy — a then-novel technique where crime scene DNA evidence can be combined with a genealogist’s sleuthing to identify a suspect through public ancestry databases.

Talbott became the first person in the world to be convicted by a jury in such a case. He was sentenced to life in prison for two counts of aggravated murder in the first degree.

The investigation, trial and conviction drew international coverage and television specials.

Meanwhile, Talbott appealed.

Three Division I judges on the state Court of Appeals found Monday that one of the jurors, No. 40, demonstrated “actual bias” while being questioned during jury selection and that further questioning had not clarified that she could set aside her biases and base her verdict strictly on the evidence.

Under questioning from attorneys, the juror expressed that “if it’s a case involving violence and women, it’s just something that I’ve already experienced in my life, and I fear that I will always inherently have as a mother, so that’s just the one thing that I probably couldn’t get past.”

“I mean,” a deputy prosecutor asked, “you would be a great juror on a different kind of case, it’s just not this kind of case.”

The juror replied that he was right.

She went on to say that she was unsure if she could be fair because “a flood of emotion might come over me … and cloud my judgment.”

“After her clear, repeated expressions of actual bias as to the precise nature of the allegations at the heart of this trial and evidence which would be introduced, we cannot conclude that juror 40 was sufficiently rehabilitated such that Talbott was provided a fair and impartial jury,” reads the ruling, authored by Court of Appeals Judge Cecily Hazelrigg.

Talbott’s appellate attorneys raised many other issues related to the evidence in the case, as did Talbott in court papers he prepared himself.

Only the question of juror bias was addressed in the ruling Monday.

The court did not address any concerns related to forensic genealogy.

Cook and Van Cuylenborg, of Vancouver Island, were on a trip to Seattle to pick up furnace parts on Nov. 18, 1987. Within days, their bodies were found many miles away.

Cook had been beaten, strangled and left dead beside a bridge near Monroe.

Van Cuylenborg had been shot in the head near Mount Vernon.

No suspect was arrested for over 30 years. Then DNA linked Talbott to the crime.
