MORE WHATCOM NUMBERS Other Whatcom County COVID data shows that: ▪ With 72 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported Friday, Whatcom County has had a pandemic total of 17,069 cases. The county’s case total increased by 473 last week, which was fewer than the 337 increase seen two weeks earlier (weekly data was not available the week of Thanksgiving, due to the state not reporting data on Thanksgiving or National Native American Heritage Day). ▪ Whatcom saw an additional two probable cases reported Friday, resulting from a positive antigen test not confirmed by a molecular test, bringing its pandemic total to 1,470 probable cases. Whatcom had 38 probable cases reported last week — the same as two weeks earlier. ▪ Whatcom’s weekly infection rate stands at 169 cases per 100,000 residents based on the state’s most recently completed data from Nov. 18-24, which is up from 157 from the week before (Nov. 11-17). Whatcom has the seventh-highest weekly infection rate of the 39 counties in the state, according to the state dashboard. ▪ With three COVID-related hospitalizations reported Friday, Whatcom has seen 955 hospitalizations reported during the pandemic.

All 39 Washington state’s 39 counties, except for Ferry County, are listed in the “High” category.
