PORT ORCHARD — Although the annual Festival of Chimes and Lights celebration was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic for the second year in a row, the holiday lights and cheer nonetheless were in evidence Saturday night on Bay Street.

A long lineup of vehicles slowly inched their way on Port Orchard’s typically busy downtown boulevard as drivers and passengers took in the colorful decorations on 55 miniature Christmas trees placed in planters outside businesses on Bay Street.

As was the case last year, holiday lights brightened the walk next to the Port Orchard Marina, which also featured vessels decked out in decorations. Santa Claus welcomed the December holiday season aboard a lighted vintage fire truck that traveled along the downtown streets.
