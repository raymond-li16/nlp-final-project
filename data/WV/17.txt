BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. (WV News) — OraCare, a professional dental rinse, was recently named Best of Class award winner.

The rinse is made by the company of the same name, which is headquartered in Bridgeport.

This award is considered the Oscars of dentistry, according to a release from the company. Tens of thousands of hygiene products were evaluated by an expert panel of industry leaders and educators in a rigorous voting process.


OraCare was the only rinse selected among the 21 winners. This is especially significant in the award's inaugural year, as the hygiene panel voted on essential products they felt were key to successful dental health, according to the release.

“We are beyond honored to have been chosen for dentistry's most prestigious award,” said OraCare CEO Dr. Robert Martino. “And we’re especially excited about being the inaugural winners because we were up against every dental hygiene product ever made.”

OraCare uses a unique two-step system which utilizes activated chlorine dioxide and has the ability to kill oral pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, neutralize VSC’s and breaks up biofilm (dental plaque) as well as help alleviate the oral side effects brought on by chemo and radiation treatment for cancer patients, according to the release.

Dr. Martino owns and operates seven dental practices in West Virginia, presiding as CEO of Wilmar Management Company. He authored “You Don’t Know What You Don’t Know”, a guide for the new dental school graduate.

He is also a founder and CEO of EASW, a worldwide aeronautics company located in Bridgeport, WV.

In 2013, Dr. Martino founded Freedom Day USA, a national thank-you movement that has given over $35 million in free services to active military, veterans and their immediate family members.

His most recent charitable movement “OraCare Cares” has donated OraCare’s mouth rinse to thousands of cancer patients across the country to help with the oral side effects of treatment.
