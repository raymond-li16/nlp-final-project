“Marshall believed that acts of kindness, both big and small, could change lives,” Copple said. And that’s just what he did as a Lion. From health fair eyesight screenings to quarterly highway litter pickups to our Diabetes Awareness roadblocks to grilling burgers for our football jamboree and steaks for our annual king/queen Lion cookout to selling sports program ads – he could be counted on to do his part and a little extra.”

Copple also recounted that for many years right through the last tournament in 2019, Marshall served as chair of the Fayetteville Lions Club’s annual weeklong “Tip-Off” Basketball Classic. He noted that Marshall also chaired the club’s Historical/Museum Committee and frequently served as a Tail Twister “bringing humor and good cheer, as well as blessed brevity to their meetings.”

Copple further remembered how Marshall loved to work on Lions construction projects, co-chairing the recent build of a picnic pavilion at Kids Park and the creation of a Lions History room at the Museum. He also rebuilt a wheelchair-bound citizen’s access bridge after the 2014 tornado, an effort that was cited in the Lions International magazine and read by 1.4 million Lions worldwide.

Marshall earned many Lions awards during his 50 years including the Melvin Jones Fellow, Lindsey-Jennings Fellow, Fayetteville Lion of the Year and Lion of the Decade, and District 12-S Lion of the Year. He served in a variety of leadership roles ranging from first vice district governor, district liaison to Lions Services to the Blind in Arkansas, as well as Fayetteville club president from 1974-1975.
