Livingston Academy was put under lockdown Thursday morning, Dec. 2 while Livingston Police investigated a report of a student with a gun in the parking lot.

According to LPD, at approximately 7:30 a.m., a student made a report of observing another student in the high school parking lot with a gun. That information was immediately relayed to Sgt. Jeremy Laycock.

At the time, Sgt. Laycock and SRO Jenna Roberts were on campus and in the student parking lot. At this point, the school went on lockdown. Sgt Laycock asked for additional LPD officers to respond, and in under 2 minutes, LPD had an additional five officers on campus, as well as deputies from Overton County Sheriff’s Department.

Students that were still in the parking lot were asked to remain in their vehicles, and traffic coming in and out of Bradford-Hicks Drive was halted to secure the area..

Sgt Laycock located the suspect student within a few minutes, and the student was detained and searched for any weapons and none were found on his person.

When asked about having a gun, the student immediately cooperated and advised he had a BB gun, which was a pistol style, in his vehicle, according to LPD. At this point, which was within 7 minutes of the initial report, the school went to a soft lockdown, with students and some of the parents dropping off being held in place until the BB gun was recovered from the vehicle.

From the time of the initial report until the release of the parking lot was about 20 minutes.

Police Chief Greg Etheredge stated, “The case is still under investigation by LPD, but there does not appear that the student had any malicious intent to cause harm.”
