The Clearwater County Chamber of Commerce’s Orofino Christmas Festival is planned for this Friday. Kick off your holiday season by attending the Old Fashioned Lighted Christmas Parade, beginning at 6 p.m. at C Street and Michigan. This year’s Mrs. Claus is Nancy Greene, and her Grand Clauses are husband, Scott, and son, Jeff, all of Peck. The always-loved Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony at Cannon Park will be held immediately following the parade.

Pictures with Santa will be available in the Gazebo at the Orofino City Park Friday evening, and there will be a Live Nativity set up for everyone to enjoy at the east entrance of the park.

The Bald Mountain Ski Sale and Swap is scheduled for Friday, Dec. 3, and Saturday, Dec. 4, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the old Junior High Gym in Orofino.

Remember to shop local and support the businesses that support events like these. Without your patronage, none of this is possible. Thank you to the Chamber’s Executive Director Erica Holland, the Chamber members and volunteers for making this a highlight of Orofino’s Christmas season.
