MILL HALL — This fall, the Tuscarora Wayne Mutual Group Foundation presented a $1,000 check on behalf of the Davis Insurance Agency, LLC to be given to a 501c(3) charity of their choice. Mark Davis, Jr. and his team selected the Keystone Central School Backpack Program to be the recipient of this donation.

The Keystone Central Foundation works with local businesses, such as the Davis Insurance Agency, LLC to provide tax deductible contributions to support educational initiatives within the district.

With a surprise of their own, the Davis Insurance Agency, LLC doubled the contribution and actually presented a check for $2,000.

The district will apply the monies to established School Backpack Programs. These programs provide students with easy to prepare foods that go home in their backpacks just before each weekend and school breaks. Director of Pupil Services, Christina Manning, reports that approximately 250 families are served through the School Backpack Programs each year.

The Tuscarora Wayne Mutual Group established a vision for providing healthy foods to children in need.

“The district is very grateful to be the recipient of the philanthropic initiatives of this group and of our local business the Davis Insurance Agency, LLC,” a press release from KCSD said.
