HAVERFORD — In a sign that school districts take any threat of guns to school safety seriously following the recent school shooting in Michigan, Haverford School District officials alerted parents of an incident that occurred in the district over the weekend involving a student reportedly posting a picture of a gun on social media.

On Saturday officials at Haverford High School received an anonymous report about the picture of a gun through the Safe2Say reporting system according to a notification sent to all high school parents on Sunday.

Safe2Say is a youth violence prevention program run by the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General with support from violence prevention advocates that teaches youth and adults how to recognize warning signs and signals, especially within social media, from individuals who may be a threat to themselves or others. Students can use an app to alert officials of a possible threat.

Haverford Police responded to the home of the student and determined the situation not to be a threat. Police met with the student and parents who were cooperative officials said.

The police and school officials said the student was apologetic for any stress that the post caused and deleted it from social media.

“Thank you to the students that continue to report any concerning incidents,” said Haverford Principal Pete Donaghy. “The Police and HHS Administration will continue to investigate all concerning issues immediately.”

On Monday police were at the school to show their support of all staff and students.
