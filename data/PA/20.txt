GREENVILLE â€“ Greenville-West Salem police determined that a rumored threat against Greenville School District was false.

The school notified police Sunday night that some parents were upset about social media activity that referred to a threat of violence at Greenville High School Monday, said Cpl. Wes Carson, the school resource officer.

"Officers spoke to numerous students last night by going to their homes," Carson said. "We take this very seriously."

Carson said after the overnight investigation, Greenville police decided that the threat was not credible and there was no reason for concern.

Carson compared the threat rumor to the telephone game.

"I think that's what happened here," Carson said. "Someone says one thing and social media blows it completely out of portion."

He said his fellow officers did an excellent job of investigating the case and closing it by morning.

The rumored social media post stated that someone was going to bring guns to school. Officers, however, could not find the post.

Carson said he doesn't know if the post actually exists, but if he finds out it does, police could file charges.

"I'm still in the process of working with the school to find the original alleged post," Carson said, adding that he can serve a search warrant to the website. "I will find that post and people will be facing several charges."

He said police will not put up with threats, real or fabricated.

"If someone is going to act like this, they're going to pay the price," Carson said.
