Past infection may not fend off omicron, study suggests
South African health experts warned that reinfections among people who’ve previously contracted COVID-19 appear to be more common than with previous variants like delta.

The findings are preliminary and haven’t yet undergone scientific review, but the timing of a spike in reinfections coinciding with the arrival of omicron suggests that the variant “demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection,” researchers wrote.

Additionally, the omicron variant is likely to have picked up genetic material from another virus that causes the common cold, according to another preliminary study by researchers from Cambridge-based firm Nference. This would mean the omicron variant could be far more contagious than previous variants, but the study is in preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.
