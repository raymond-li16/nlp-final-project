COLUMBUS, Ind. — A local man facing several felonies following the drug-related death of his 8-year-son has made his first court appearance.

Travis E. Tuttle, 35, of 4373 Serenity Drive, appeared via video conferencing from the jail for his initial hearing before Bartholomew Superior Court 1 Judge James Worton.
