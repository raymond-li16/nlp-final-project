LINCOLN -- The Beatrice wrestling team got its season off to a hot start by winning the Lincoln Pius X Invite on Saturday.

The Orangemen finished with 192 points, which put them ahead of runner-up Lincoln Pius X's 139.5 points and third place Norris' 125.5 points.

It was an exciting day for Cole Maschmann, who went 5-0 on the day in the 160-pound division and picked up his 100th career win.

Torrance Keehn was named the tournament's "Outstanding Wrestler" with his first place finish in the 182-pound division. Keehn, who finished state runner-up last year, went 5-0 on the day and beat Class A No. 3 Justin Davis from Omaha Central 12-9 to claim his gold medal.

Two-time defending state champion Trevor Reinke got his season off to a good start with a 2-0 record and winning the 138-pound division.

Other first place finishes for the Orangemen include Jordan Creek in the 120-pound division finishing 2-0; Bryce Karlin in the 126-pound division finishing 3-0; Colton Jelinek in the 132-pound division finishing 5-0; and Deegan Nelson in the 195-pound division finishing 3-0.

Beatrice will be in action again on Saturday when they travel to the Crete Invite.

Norris got a first place finish from Cooper Spaulding in the 170-pound division.
