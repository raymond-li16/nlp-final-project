Coming home is often difficult, but for Nathan, a military veteran, coming home meant bringing with him the toll of serving.

Because of a traumatic injury, Nathan was dealing with flashbacks and memory loss at his place of employment and didn’t want to injure anyone because of them. He stepped down from his job in May, and has not had a paycheck in three months.

Nathan’s memory loss makes it so that sometimes he cannot even find his way home from the grocery store. It is a real struggle, as his only limited medical help is coming from the Veterans Administration services.

“I can’t let my family suffer because of my illness,” Nathan said. “Any help we can get will be realty appreciated.”

With all that Nathan has gone through from the numerous bills, losing his car and waiting for Social Security benefits to come in, there is nothing for his two children this Christmas.

Nathan would like a Santa’s helper to help him this year make sure his two girls have presents under the tree.

His youngest is 3.5 years old and needs a Sunday dress or two. She wears a size 8 pant and shirt and size 9 shoe. Her favorite color is purple. She loves children’s story books like Mother Goose and Dr. Seuss. For toys she loves dinosaurs and a doctor play set.

The oldest girl is nearly 14 years old and needs shirts, pants, socks, shoes and underwear. She wears as size medium and 6.5 size adult shoe. Her favorite color is also purple. She loves Harry Potter and K-pop band BTS books. She would like a wand, crystal ball and BTS band items.
