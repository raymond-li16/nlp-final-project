A mock crash scenario was held at Wasatch High School Friday to help students understand the dangers of distracted driving.

Students were able to watch a mock crash unfold, and see what happens following an incident where one student dies as a result of distracted driving.

The event was cosponsored by Wasatch County Sheriffs Office, Heber City Police Department, Utah Highway Patrol, Wasatch County Fire and EMS, Heber Valley Funeral Home and the Wasatch County Health Department.
