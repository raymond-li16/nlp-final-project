In addition to decking the halls with 28 magically adorned Christmas trees, like the Elms mansion above, The Breakers façade and nearly half of its 13-acre property will once again be aglow this season as tens of thousands of festive, colored lights illuminate the mansion’s gardens, paths and trees, with extra surprises and holiday music along the way. A separate ticket is required for the family-friendly “Sparkling Lights at The Breakers,” which is open evenings from 5 to 7 p.m., Thursday through Sunday, visit newportmansions.org for more on dates and tickets.
