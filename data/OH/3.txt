ADA - The Ada girls basketball team raced to a big early lead and thoroughly dominated Perry 52-22 in a non-conference game Saturday afternoon.

Ada ran out to a 17-2 lead and never trailed in the mismatch. The Bulldog girls used good defense and solid offense to put together perhaps their best 32 minutes of basketball this season.

The Lady Bulldogs improved to 2-3 overall with the lopsided win. The Commodores fell to 0-4 with the defeat.
	
"Overall, it was a good team effort," said Ada head coach Morgan Bass. "We did some really good things defensively together. We did a pretty good job on help-side defense.	
	
"We had some moments of penetration on offense," she added.

Ada junior guard Courtney Sumner led all scorers with 20 points and five steals. Point guard Olivia Burkhart netted 15 points and played a fine floor game.

Sophomore Burkhart sank a pair of one-footed runners to shoot Ada to an early 7-0 lead.

Stymied by the Bulldog defense, cold-shooting Perry did not score until 2:30 remained in the opening stanza on a 14-footer from Tyannah Gordon.

Sumner then took over. The speedy junior hit a driving left-handed banker and two free throws. She then stole the ball, sped upcourt and finished a three-point play for a 15-2 lead.

Burkhart nailed a running right side 16-footer at the buzzer to extend the margin to 15 points after one period of play.

Sumner knocked down a top of the key trifecta to open the second stanza. Perry ran off seven unanswered points to threaten to get back in the game at 21-9.

But Burkhart stopped the run with a pair of charity stripers, followed by a short bank shot from Daicy Robinson. Sumner came up with another swipe and breakaway layup. She then scored on a driving layin to make it 29-9 and cap an 8-0 flurry.

Gordon drained a trey, but senior Selena Jordan made a short bank shot just before halftime to put Ada comfortably on top, 31-12.

Burkhart drilled a three from the top of the key to start the second half. Jordan canned a layin before a triple by Perry's Mary Hoersten.

Burkhart then mad ea nice driving layup down the left baseline. Katie Sizemore knocked in a short banker to give the hosts a 41-15 cushion heading to the final quarter.

Jordan swished a five-footer, followed by two free throws and a transition banker from Sumner for a 43-17 margin. Sophomore southpaw Mariah King then netted the final five Ada points on a foul shot, a bank shot and a fast break shot off glass to provide the final margin of 30.

King and Jordan each added six markers to suppor the 35 points from the Ada backcourt of Sumner and Burkhart. No Commodore scored more than five points.
 
The Bulldogs canned 19 field goals, including 17 two-pointers and two trifectas. Ada converted on 12 of 20 attempts from the charity stripe (60 percent).

The Commodores sank just eight field goals, including four two-pointers and four triples. They converted two of four free throws (50 percent).
