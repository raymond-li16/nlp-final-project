An 82-year-old Pima resident who pulled a gun on another man in July has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct.

According to Graham County Superior Court records, Herman Garcia will be sentenced to three years' probation on Dec. 27 and if he successfully completes it, the Class 6 felony will be dropped to a misdemeanor.

According to a Graham County Sheriff's Office report, a local man told deputies he had just dropped off a passenger in the parking lot of an East Highway 70 business when an elderly man blocked the exit with his vehicle and "pointed/waved" a silver handgun at him. The victim said he jumped a curb to get away.

Garcia denied pulling a gun on anyone, but admitted to blocking the other driver's vehicle. Deputies found a .45 caliber handgun, which had a round in the chamber, on the floorboard of Garcia's vehicle, the report said.

According to the report, Garcia believed the couple inside the vehicle were the same people he'd loaned a trailer to, but had failed to return it.
