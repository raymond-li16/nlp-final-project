ABismarck-area state lawmaker is making a bid to jump from the House to the Senate next year.

Rep. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, announced his state Senate bid on Monday. He was first elected in 2016 to represent District 28, of south-central North Dakota.

After the Legislature reapportioned its districts last month from 2020 census data, Magrum is in the new District 8, which has an open Senate seat on the 2022 ballot. The district comprises Emmons County, southern Burleigh County and the Lincoln area.

He said his Senate bid reflects his "firm belief in term limits," citing a proposed ballot measure he supports for term limits for the governor and Legislature.

Magrum is a rancher and master plumber. In the 2021 Legislature, he led the so-called "stand your ground" bill which expands a person's rights to use deadly force in certain instances.

He advocated election-integrity bills in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. North Dakota had no documented election fraud in 2020, and President Donald Trump's claims of widespread fraud in the national election have been rejected by election officials, judges and Trump's attorney general at the time.
