The state Health Department's coronavirus dashboard showed 109 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, 2,883 active cases with 485 in Burleigh-Morton counties, and three new deaths.

Those deaths brought the pandemic total to 1,915, with 118 in November. Filing of official death certificates can take up to 10 days under state law.

The state's 14-day rolling average test positivity rate, at 7.6%, was the highest in six weeks, and continued to be well above the state target of less than 5%.
