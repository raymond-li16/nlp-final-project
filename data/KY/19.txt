Medina Spirit, the first-place finisher of the 147th Kentucky Derby, died Monday morning according to trainer Bob Baffert.

The horse had finished a five-furlong workout at Santa Anita Park in California before he collapsed and died of a heart attack.

Medina Spirit won the Kentucky Derby earlier this year, although that win is being contested after 25 picograms of betamethasone were found in one milliliter of the horse's blood.
