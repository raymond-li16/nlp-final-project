Clay Police Department was approved to purchase a new Taser. The taser will be purchased from Axxon Enterprise located in Scottsdale, Arizona. It was quoted at $3,450.07, and will include replacement carts for five years, two yearsâ€™ worth of training carts, and a five-year warranty.

Clay Fire Department had six rescue calls and four fire runs in October. There have been a strain of fire runs late at night.

Several residents passed their third notice from code enforcement, some of which have even received fourth notices. The panel in place may decide to send fines to residents with more than three notices. Residents will have seven days to appeal fines. There have been complaints on West Elm Street of dirt bikes speeding up and down the road.

The council was scheduled to meet in a special called session last night to discuss how to use ARPA funds.
