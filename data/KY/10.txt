A former Lyon Count Middle School teacher will serve 10 years in federal prison, followed by 10 years of supervised release, for attempting to possess child pornography, acting U.S. Attorney Michael A. Bennett announced last Wednesday.

Michael McCuiston, 36, of Murray, was sentenced in the Paducah U.S. District Courthouse on Tuesday. McCuiston pleaded guilty to the crime in June. At the time of the crime and his arrest, McCuiston was living in Providence.

According to the plea agreement, McCuiston placed a hidden camera in a school bathroom and secretly recorded videos of two children.

After receiving information about these videos, authorities searched McCuistonâ€™s home. According to the sentencing memorandum, prosecutors said McCuiston admitted to setting up a camera to capture footage of a minor changing clothes.

McCuiston was initially arrested on state charges in April of 2019, but made bond in September of 2019, according to the sentencing memorandum.

In January of 2020, McCuiston was arrested on a federal indictment charging him with attempted production of child pornography, which caries a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. He pleaded guilty to attempted possession of child pornography, which has a 10-year statutory maximum sentence, and the original attempted production charge was dismissed.
