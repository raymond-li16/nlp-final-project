In the giving mood for the holidays? These NJ shelters, housing non-profits could use help

More than 8,000 New Jerseyans slept in shelters or on the streets in January, and that estimate is most likely a vast undercount of the Garden State’s homeless population. 

And still more financially-strapped tenants may be at risk of eviction once the state eviction moratorium ends Dec. 31 if they can’t make January’s rent.

Yet homeless shelters are still trying to get back to normal after cutting available beds to promote social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more on cleaning supplies, personal protective gear and more. 

State and local governments are passing out rental assistance and other checks for housing expenses, but even with financial help, New Jerseyans face barriers to finding stable affordable housing.

Shelters, community groups, nonprofits, churches and others try to fill in the gaps. They provide spare beds or pass out checks to help residents with rent, a security deposit, or home repairs. They counsel families about how to buy their first home, step in before a family faces eviction to work out a deal with landlords, or build new, affordable homes for those in need.

For those in need, or for people who want to help their neighbors secure safe housing, here's a list of local organizations providing that help.

Read more about the groups and their missions, how to get help, or discover what support they need, whether through volunteers, donations, spearheading events or just spreading the word. The groups listed below come from HousinghelpNJ.org, NJ211 and the Department of Community Affairs.
