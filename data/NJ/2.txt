RED BANK, NJ – The New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the African American Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey honored the Pascale Sykes Foundation as a “diversity champion” on November 10, 2021.

As a diversity advocate, the Pascale Sykes Foundation has been at the forefront of ensuring a range of opportunities would be afforded to those most in need. For more than 30 years, President Frances P. Sykes and the Foundation have played a key role in uplifting and investing in community organizations and working, low-income families in New Jersey and New York. Since its opening, the Pascale Sykes Foundation and its substantial grants have serviced numerous social service collaborations by investing roughly $60 million in more than 75 NJ- and NY-based community organizations and initiatives. This has contributed directly to the positive development and well-being of children and families throughout our region.

Central to its success, the Pascale Sykes Foundation’s Whole Family Approach is a preventive rather than crisis-driven approach. It is a family-led strategy that provides adults and children with the tools and social support to collectively set life goals, create actionable plans, and achieve those goals. When the whole family works together to support each other’s goals, long-term change, stability and well-being become a reality. Empowering families with the tools to reach their goals and stay out of poverty has far better long-term benefits than intervening after they are in crisis.


“While it is a tremendous honor to accept this award on behalf of the Pascale Sykes Foundation, it is an even greater honor and privilege to be of service to so many different communities,” stated Susan Kyrillos, Acting President of the Pascale Sykes Foundation.

In the spring of 2020, when many small businesses nationwide struggled to remain afloat, the Pascale Sykes Foundation and New Jersey Community Capital (NJCC) expanded the THRIVE initiative to provide emergency funding for small businesses and nonprofits affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Pascale Sykes Foundation sought to establish and implement long-term solutions for underserved communities after the Association of Black Foundation Executives sent out a call to action in 2020. Furthering its commitment to diversity, on March 10, 2021, Mrs. Sykes presented a $1,000,000 check to New Jersey Community Capital and the African American Chamber of Commerce to create and benefit the Equitable Small Business Initiative. This $1,000,000 contribution creates opportunities for Black Business Enterprises (BBEs) in New Jersey seeking access to resources and support to establish, sustain, augment, or expand business operations, especially while these businesses grapple with the economic downturn.
