Everything inside the home was damaged in the fire.

The fire caused $150,000 in damage, according to the state fire marshal.

The family of five has been living at the Home2 Suites in Lewes since the fire displaced them.

The roof and inside of the home were damaged by the fire.
Andy Lauzon was working in the yard of a Lincoln home his family rents when he first saw smoke.

“He saw smoke and that was it,” said his wife, Roseann Lauzon. “It is very odd.”

Roseann said the family lost everything in the Nov. 29 fire that ripped through the roof of the house, damaging everything inside. The family of five had lived in the home for five years, Roseann said. None of their furniture could be saved. She said they are thankful their children were at school, and no one was hurt. Two of their children attend school in Milford, and one goes to Howard T. Ennis School.

John M. Galaska, chief deputy state fire marshal, said the fire is still under investigation, but it caused $150,000 in damage.

Since the fire, the family has been living in the Home2 Suites in Lewes. “We’re trying to figure out our next move,” Roseann said. Ideally, she said, they would like another rental no more than $1,500 a month that can accommodate their family and three dogs.

A GoFundMe site has been set up to help pay for their loss and help them get on their feet again, Roseann said.
