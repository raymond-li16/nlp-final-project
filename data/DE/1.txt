Student organizations at John M. Clayton Elementary School in Frankford collaborated to organize a Thanksgiving food drive during November

The JMC National Elementary Honor Society and Girls on the Run team collected more than 1,000 nonperishable items and sorted them into boxes for families in need.

School staff members and some outside organizations also donated gift cards for local grocery stores so that families could purchase their own turkeys for their holiday feast.

With the help of School Counselor Jan Bomhardt, these student organizations distributed boxes to more than 30 families in the community, with more remaining for distribution over the winter season.
