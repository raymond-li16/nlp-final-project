A re­cent re­port on Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio sug­gests the Que­bec Maple Syrup Pro­duc­ers just dumped a large amount of syrup on the world mar­ket.  While the or­ga­ni­za­tion, which main­tains a strate­gic re­serve of the sweet stuff, has re­leased about half of its stock­pile, David Mar­vin of But­ter­nut Farms in John­son, says the or­ga­ni­za­tion started mak­ing its move soon af­ter see­ing last year’s crop was poor due to a short sea­son.

Canada makes about 70 per­cent of the world’s maple syrup and the or­ga­ni­za­tion main­tains its stock­pile to pro­tect farm­ers and con­sumers from ma­jor price swings which could ei­ther leave pro­duc­ers with­out a profit if prices drop or drive con­sumers away if they rise too high.
