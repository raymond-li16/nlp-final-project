Innovate, thrive, forward-thinking, servant-leader, inspire, seek, sustain, growth, support, legacy — these are all words that describe the mission of K-State Research and Extension. 

They’re also words that describe Roger and Carol Black, the 2021 Cowley County Extension Appreciation Award recipients.  

Roger and Carol Black were destined to be involved. Carol’s great-grandfather homesteaded in Cowley County and her family set an example of involvement in the community and extension.  Carol, daughter of Jasper and Bea DeVore from Arkansas City, grew up in 4-H with her mother as the founding community leader for the Cameron 4-H Club. Carol and her siblings were active in Cowley County 4-H.  

Roger grew up in Choctaw County, Okla.  His exposure to 4-H was through his school, as at that time, Oklahoma clubs were school-based and agent supervised. As a teen, he continued his involvement in local youth organizations through his local FFA chapter.  

Roger became acquainted with extension as a student at his state’s land grant institution, where he worked as a research assistant. This developed in him a strong interest in helping others find the answers they need to become more productive, a value that he believes is beneficial to producers and a valuable role that Extension continues to play. 

His work-study job at Oklahoma State University is what led to him work for Carol’s dad and his relocation to Kansas.  

Carol and Roger served Cowley County 4-H before becoming 4-H parents themselves. As a young married couple, they served as sponsors for the 4-H Junior Leaders organization. Through their involvement, youth began to hold fundraising events to allow them to participate in interstate 4-H exchange trips.

They learned to set high expectations and believe in the youth they were impacting. They found that those kids who participated in the various fundraisers and trips created a more cohesive group.

The Black’s continued the 4-H tradition with their three children – Liz, Jason and Brian. Their children were members of the Cameron 4-H Club, and Roger and Carol continued their service as adult volunteers throughout their kids 4-H careers.  

As producers, the Black’s continue to utilize extension in their operation. They work with state and area specialists to explore ways to improve their own operations as well as the customers they serve. 

Roger builds connections with agents and specialists across the state asking questions of the university, bringing topics to the forefront, which sometimes results in further investigation and research, and nearly always an increase in learning. 

Roger serves as the president of the Kansas Forage and Grassland Council. This group supports research and education in forage production and grassland management. 

Wichita is the host site for both the American Forage Council and the International Conference in 2022. This group actively works with KSU to staff forage research and extension positions and fund millions in research dollars. 

Roger was one of the founding members with Gary Kilgore. Roger is the chairman of the Grouse-Silver Watershed Board and serve on the regional advisory committee for the Kansas water office.

In addition to countless civic and church organizations, Roger has served on multiple committees for Cowley County Extension. He is a past active member of the Cowley County Livestock Association Board as well as the Agriculture and Natural Resources Program Development Committee, part of the Cowley County Extension Council. 

He also served on the Cowley County Extension Council Executive Board various times throughout the 1970s and 2000s, and recently finished serving two terms in 2020. 

He was a founding member of the Cowley County Friends of Extension group that developed Cowley County Extension’s “Fall for Extension” fundraising event. 

Roger and Carol continue their service to Cowley County Extension. They cooperate in field days, provide insight and research to the agents and are actively involved as Friends of Extension. 

Their leadership and service has benefited Cowley County Extension programs as well as the local community. Their participation and leadership in Cowley County Extension spans across seven decades and has been a true influence in the presence of extension in Cowley County.

The Cowley County Extension Council is honoring Roger and Carol Black with the 2021 Cowley County Extension Appreciation Award for their years of service and commitment to Cowley County. 

They were recognized at the Fall for Extension event on Nov. 20. They will also have additional recognition at the Cowley County Extension Council Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
