Chatham County Board of Commissioners to hold special meeting December 8
December 6, 2021
Pittsboro, NC – The Chatham County Board of Commissioners (BOC) will hold a special meeting on Wednesday, December 8, 2021, at 9:00 a.m. at the Chatham County Historic Courthouse, 9 Hillsboro Street, Second Floor Courtroom, Pittsboro. Face coverings are required for all individuals while inside the building.


The purpose of the meeting is to receive a presentation and update on the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) and vote on a request to approve an appropriation of $260,000 for the FY23 Human Services Nonprofit Allocation funding process and to approve the continuation of the FY22 Board of Commissioner’s Goal and Outcomes for the FY23 Human Services Nonprofit Allocation funding process.

Individuals may locate the meeting agenda, agenda packet and livestream on the Legistar website (https://chathamnc.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx) using the below instructions:

For first-time visitors to the site, click on the drop-down list next to the search field and select “All Years.” Then click the “Meeting Date” column to sort by most recent meeting to oldest meeting. These settings should save for any return visits to the site.
For livestreaming, look for column on the right that says “Video.” Directly underneath, it currently says “Not Available” for the video of the December 8th meeting. 
When the meeting starts, the Video column will say “In Progress” for the December 8th meeting. Click on the words “In Progress” and it will go to the livestream. 
The recording of the video will be uploaded to the same spot within 24 hours of the meeting adjourning.
