Brunswick County passes election audit

 The Brunswick County Board of Elections ran a state-required pilot risk-limiting audit Nov. 18 and passed after the first count.

According to a press release from the North Carolina Election Boards, a risk-limiting audit is a “hand-to-eye recount of randomly selected sample ballots.” It is to provide evidence the machine counts are correct.

The audit was done so state and county election officials can learn how about the process. It is intended to be used for future elections.

Brunswick County Board of Elections Director Sara LaVere said the state decided they should pull ballots for Brunswick Regional Water and Sewer H2Go Commissioner to test.

The staff pulled all of the ballots from that election from 38 predetermined batches staff already made. The batches from each bin were about 50 ballots each.

“The thinking was the more ballots in a batch you could have to count, I feel like the more you are counting, the more likely you are maybe to miss one,” LaVere said.

Then they hand-tallied the ballots. It took about 30 minutes to count it up.

She said the state decides on how many ballots to pull and which election to pull from. LaVere said the number is based on how many ballots were casted and how close the contest was.

This particular one wasn’t close, but if it had been, there is a chance the staff would have been counting more ballots.

She said as the staff pulled the ballots, the staff also put placeholders so they can put the ballots back in the correct spot.

If the staff had to count a second list, LaVere said the hand tally would have not provided the “confidence” to show the results were correct.

The confidence level is 85%.

The staff would then be given a second list of ballots to pull.

Brunswick County was participating along with 16 other counties. Buncombe, Scotland, Watauga and Brunswick were scheduled to submit results that morning. The state dealt with one county at a time, which made two county staff members who did the count and the witnesses who were two board members and a state employee to wait over 30 minutes.

When they passed, the staff began to put the ballots back. They sealed the bins and pushed them out to the warehouse. The ballots have to be stored for at least 22 months before they can be destroyed.

The whole process was livestreamed by the county.
