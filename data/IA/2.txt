The Albia City Council discussed applying for a grant to complete a housing assessment during their Nov. 15 meeting.

Nichole Moore, Executive Director of Chariton Valley Planning and Development, called in to the meeting to talk about the opportunity. According to Moore the state of Iowa has just released new funding to help city’s complete housing development assessments. The city of Albia would be responsible for matching a $5,000 grant for the program if they decide to move forward with the project and receive a grant from the state.

Moore said housing assessments can help towns know what kind of housing stock they have including the number of rentals versus owned homes as well as any open lots the town has and the state of their housing stock, like homes in need of repair or rehab.

Moore said the assessment, which is completed through the Iowa State University Extension, can help town with updating their Planning and Zoning ordinances as well as help city’s as well as citizens them apply for grants, loans and other opportunities related to housing.

City Council members asked Moore to supply them with some more information about the program and how housing assessments are used before making a final decision. This extra round of funding must be applied for by Dec. 1. If the city decides not to move forward with a housing assessment at this time, but later wants to, Moore said funding would most likely be available in the future as well through the state’s normal yearly funding of the program.

The city council received one bid for repair work on the Albia City Hall sewer from Lathrop Farms for $4,900. The council approved the bid. This was the second time the council sought bids as they received no bids during the first search.
