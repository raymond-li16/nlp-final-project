Starting in 1983, the Hot Springs Village Community Foundation, recently presented checks to several local service associations. “To date, our foundation has awarded one million dollars, and today we’ll be granting checks sharing 17,000 in funds raised to these very special organizations, “ said Kim Harrison, Executive Director.
Governor Mike Huckabee welcomed attendees and shared personal experiences regarding those who give. He recalled many family experiences, one being very appropriate to share honoring those who give. After his son accidentally turned the freezer off in their home; all the items inside were thawed, but still cold. As they couldn’t refreeze all the food, the family cooked every item and invited all their friends and neighbors to enjoy the meal and take more home.  “When I laid down to sleep I realized if I bagged up the food and put it out with the trash, I would have felt miserable. Giving it away and watching everyone having a good time, made me very happy. Do I want to be sad or happy. Do I throw things away or give them? Giving is the best,” he said.
