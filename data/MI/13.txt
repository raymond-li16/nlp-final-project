New coronavirus cases leaped in Michigan in the week ending Sunday, rising 80.6% as 70,095 cases were reported. The previous week had 38,811 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Michigan ranked third among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. In the latest week coronavirus cases in the United States increased 67.6% from the week before, with 843,458 cases reported. With 3% of the country's population, Michigan had 8.31% of the country's cases in the last week. Across the country, 48 states had more cases in the latest week than they did in the week before.

Thanksgiving significantly disrupted who got tested, how many people got tested, what labs operated and what government agencies reported on time. Some governments reported three days of data for Thanksgiving week; some reported none. The reporting of many cases and deaths were shifted from Thanksgiving's week into last week, making Thanksgiving week artificially low and the latest week artificially high, skewing the week-to-week comparison. These numbers are unreliable even as they're accurate to what states reported.

Wayne County reported 10,512 cases and 159 deaths in the latest week. A week earlier, it had reported 5,721 cases and 44 deaths. Throughout the pandemic it has reported 234,312 cases and 5,975 deaths.

Within Michigan, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Schoolcraft County with 1,186 cases per 100,000 per week; Keweenaw County with 1,134; and Shiawassee County with 1,077. The Centers for Disease Control says high levels of community transmission begin at 100 cases per 100,000 per week.

Adding the most new cases overall were Wayne County, with 10,512 cases; Oakland County, with 8,335 cases; and Macomb County, with 6,723. Weekly case counts rose in 82 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties.
