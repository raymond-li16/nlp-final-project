An occasional crank phone call is bad enough, but imagine getting them repeatedly throughout the day.

That’s what one caller has been doing to the employees at a Southgate fast food restaurant.

On the afternoon of Nov. 26 an employee at McDonald’s, 18787 North Line Road, contacted police to report ongoing harassment by a caller.

The employee said that for approximately three months an unknown male has called the business approximately 50 times a day. She provided an officer with the number that shows up on Caller ID.

The employee said that each time the man calls, he makes rude comments about the business and will not stop calling, even though he has been asked not to call back.
