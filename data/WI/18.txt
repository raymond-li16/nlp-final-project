Bold Burgers
Bold is scheduled to open in the next few weeks on Main Street. 

The restaurant space at 106 N. Main St., which used to house BX Mexican Cuisine and Bar, will sit dark no longer. Within the next few weeks, it will become a vibrant destination for food, drink, company and dancing. 

Bold is taking the classic American comfort food and going in a fresh direction. Though there will be nothing too surprising on the menu, Ben Peterson, co-owner of Fusion Management, said customers can expect a twist. 

Over the last few months, the planning for Bold took off. The front of the venue will house a place for friends, family and coworkers to gather for lunch or dinner, complete with a curated menu of food and a drink selection, including local products. 

“Business in the front, party in the back,” depicts the adaptable atmosphere of Bold. 

Though potentially a later opening, the back of the venue will hold a dance floor for evening excitement. Peterson anticipates bringing in live DJs and live musicians down the line. 

There will be a space for everyone. 

Fusion Management was created by Peterson and co-owner Brian Sandy in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for businesses. 

“It was born out of a couple other businesses that had kind of gone under during the pandemic,” said Peterson. “A need to adjust, I guess.” 

The owner of the building had been inquiring about filling the vacant space with another restaurant. Fusion, out of Eau Claire, was intrigued by the opportunity and its hospitality team will be managing Bold, which is its own limited liability corporation. 

“That bar has been set high by the other establishments here in town,” said Peterson. “We have to meet a certain standard for the community to accept us. We're up to that challenge, and we're excited about that.”
