FULTON – The Fulton Rotary Club recently accepted a donation of $1,500 from Fulton Mayor Deana M. Michaels from the city’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding.

Mayor Michaels said the group is one of several local not-for-profit and service organizations that offer programs that support the community. The Fulton Club sponsors programs and community events throughout Fulton, and promotes integrity, and advances world understanding, goodwill, and peace through fellowship of business, professional, and community leaders.

The club meets most Thursdays at the Tavern on the Lock in Fulton. More information on the Fulton Rotary Club is available on Facebook at Fulton Noon Rotary Club.
