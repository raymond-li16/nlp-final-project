ARCADIA — A 100 year member of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, The Arcadia Woman’s Club celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding in November.

The clubhouse is at 2288 N.W. American Legion Way.

One of the oldest GFWC Clubs in Florida, Arcadia Woman’s Club was federated in 1921. Living the Volunteer Spirit is the Logo of GFWC Clubs and Arcadia has done that in the Desoto community for the last 100 years.

The first library in the county was created by the Arcadia Club. A school was opened and run by Club members when there was a need; annual scholarships are provided to graduating high school seniors and monthly donations go to various charities; all highlights of their community service. And they are well-known for the delicious strawberry shortcakes served annually at Pioneer Day.

To learn more about the club, including who made the birthday cake replica of the clubhouse for the 100th Anniversary Celebration, see “Arcadia Womans Club GFWC” on Facebook.
