Parade origins
The Chicago Defender was founded in 1905 by Robert Sengstacke Abbott.

In 1924, Abbott held a picnic for five of his publication's newsboys.

The first parade was held Aug. 11, 1929, when Abbott wanted to thank the children who hawked his newspaper on street corners. He could think of no better way than to give them the things they loved: ice cream, hot dogs and a day outdoors.

Who is Bud Billiken?
In 1921, Abbott started Defender Junior, a page of his weekly paper devoted to children. It grew to include a club, drawing children across the U.S. and Africa and serving as an alternative to the Boy Scouts in response to the segregation at the time.

Bud Billiken, the page's fictional editor/mascot described as the guardian and protector of children, was invented by Abbott and the Defender's executive editor, Lucius Harper. Depending on which authority you ask, the two either found the word "billiken" in a dictionary, or Harper had a carving of one on his desk.

Side note: Good-luck figurines called billikens were a popular culture craze in the early 1900s. Florence Pretz, a Kansas City art teacher, created the tubby little good-luck creature -- a cross between a Kewpie doll and a Buddha figure -- and for a while the impish-looking "god of things as they ought to be" was all the rage. The Billiken Company of Chicago manufactured dolls, banks, figurines and other souvenirs in his likeness.
